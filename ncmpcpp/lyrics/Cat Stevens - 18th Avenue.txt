Well I rode a while, for a mile or so
Down the road to the 18th Avenue
And the people I saw were the people I know
And they all came down to take a view
The path was dark and borderless
Down the road to the 18th Avenue
And it stung my tongue to repeat the words
That I used to use only yesterday
Meanings just dropped to the ground
I tried to remember what I thought
And what I used to say
Don't let me go down, no don't let me go

Oh my hands were tied as I struggled inside
The empty waste of another day
Memories were blank to my eyes
The fire and the glory of that night
Seemed safely locked away
Too hungry to rise, oh too hungry to

Well I rode a while, for a mile or so
Down the road to the 18th Avenue
And the people I saw were the people I know
And they all came down to take a view
The path was dark and borderless
Down the road to the 18th Avenue
But my head felt better as I turned the car
And the airport slowly came to view
One mile said the sign
Oh! I Checked my bags and made it straight to end gate 22
Made it just in time, boy you made it just in time
