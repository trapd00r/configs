[DMX]
Uhh.. UH! .. WHOO!

[Chorus: DMX]
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a FOOL
up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
up in here, up in here

[Verse 1: DMX]
If I gotsta bring it to you cowards then it's gonna be quick, aight
All your mens up in the jail before, suck my (Wooh!)
and all them other cats you run with, get done with, dumb quick
How the (Arf!) you gonna cross the dog with some bum (UH!)? Aight
There go the click click, nine one one (What?)
All over some dumb (Uuuh...), ain't that some (Uh!)
Y'all ... remind me of a strip club, cause everytime
you come around, it's like (what) I just gotta get my ... sucked
And I don't know who the (Grr...) you think you talkin to
but I'm not him, aight slim? So watch what you do
Or you gon' find yourself, buried next to someone else
and we all thought you loved yourself
But that couldn't have been the issue, or maybe
they just sayin that, now cause they miss you
Maybe they tried to diss you
That's why you layin on your back, lookin at the roof of the church
Preacher tellin the truth and it hurts

[Chorus: DMX]
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a FOOL
up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
up in here, up in here

[Verse2: DMX]
Off the chain I leave ... soft in the brain
still want the fame, off the name
First of all, you ain't rapped long enough
to be ... with me and you, you ain't strong enough
So whatever it is you puffin on that got you think that you Superman
I got the Kryptonite, should I smack him with my ... and the mic?
... is characters, not even good actors
What's gon' be the outcome? Hmm, let's add up all the factors
You wack, you're twisted, your girl's a (Wooh!)
You're broke, the kid ain't yours, and e'rybody know
Your old man say you stupid, you be like, "So?
I love my baby mother, I never let her go"
I'm tired of weak ... whinin over ...
that don't belong to them, ... is wrong with them?
They ... for real ... like my mans and them
who get it on on the strength of the hands with them, MAN

[Chorus: DMX]
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a FOOL
up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
up in here, up in here

[Verse 3: DMX]
I bring down rains so heavy it curse the head
No more talkin - put him in the dirt instead
You keep walin - lest you tryin to end up red
Cause if I end up fed, y'all end up dead
Cause youse a soft type (What?)
Fake up North type (Wooh!)
... like a soft white (Grr...)
Dog is a dog, blood's thicker than water
We done been through the mud and we quicker to slaughter
The bigger the order, the more (Uh!) we brought out
We run up in there, e'rybody come out, don't nobody run out
Sun in to sun out, I'ma keep the (Arf!) out
... runnin his mouth? I'ma blow his lung out
Listen, yo' (What?) is about to be missin
You know who gon' find you? (Who?) Some old man fishin
Grandma wishin your soul's at rest
but it's hard to digest with the size of the hole in your chest

[Chorus: DMX]
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a FOOL
up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
up in here, up in here
