[Havoc]
Yeah, uh-huh..

[Chorus: Havoc]
When worst comes to worst, my peoples come first
The love, the hunger, that genuine thirst
Jump for my dawgs, how that X-5 murk
At death, or at my Dunn's first childbirth
They say the truth hurt, but it hurt when I spit the truth
And I ain't gotta tell you dudes

[Evidence]
Yo, some people got good friends, at night we live our life right
(right) Intense.. on the edge
On the line, I'm from the group where friction leads to fire
Stack your chips, the time is don't miss
Now or never - remix, Alchemist
My life is good, I got my folks in the mix, so...

"When worst comes to worst, my peoples come first"

[Iriscience]
I got worldwide family all over the earth
And I worry 'bout 'em all for whatever it's worth
If the pressure gets worse the streets are gon' burst
'Til my last line, I rhyme to free minds
And if mine are needy I need to feed mine

"When worst comes to worst, my peoples come first"

[Guru]
Unconditional love for my official thugs
I got worldwide fam, I got peoples man
But if worst comes to worst, enemies catch the gunburst
Give them a quick ceremony, throw 'em all in one hearse
My niggaz know I play hard, but I get the job done first

"When worst comes to worst, my peoples come first"

[Chorus]

"When worst comes to worst, my peoples come first"

[Iriscience]
I'm a glutton for the truth, even though truth hurts
I've studied with my peoples on streets and in church
Still make it hard when we go on first
I buried Rob One with a copy of "Platform"
Like when you get to heaven, homeboy, play that for 'em

"When worst comes to worst, my peoples come first"

[Guru]
If worst comes to worst, wifey and the baby come first
Along with my moms and pops, I can't stop
My siblings, my aunts and uncles that still here
My nephews and nieces they know, I still care
To my peeps on the Ave. and locked up, we'll still be here

"When worst comes to worst, my peoples come first"

[Evidence]
Uhh - I got their back, so when day turns to night
We could go our separate ways but the song remains and stays right
(right) Just cop some trees to roll tight
For Havoc and Guru fresh off the flight (you aight?)
Without my peoples life ain't worth the fight; that's why

[Babu mixing]
"When worst comes to worst, my peoples come first"
"Worst... come to worst" .. "When worst come to worst"
"When worst comes to worst, my peoples come first"
"Worst... come to worst" .. "my peoples come first"

[Evidence]
That's Babu y'all, you know the deal

[Chorus]

[Evidence]
Check it out, nothin but love y'all
When worst come to worst, my peoples come first..
