Alright,
now listen, baby

You don't care for me
I don'-a care about that
Gotta new fool, ha!
I like it like that

I have only one burning desire
Let me stand next to your fire
Let me stand next to your fire [Repeat 4 times]

Listen here, baby
and stop acting so crazy
You say your mum ain't home,
it ain't my concern,
Just play with me and you won't get burned

I have only one itching desire
Let me stand next to your fire
Let me stand next to your fire [Repeat 4 times]

Oh! Move over, Rover
and let Jimi take over
Yeah, you know what I'm talking 'bout
Yeah, get on with it, baby
That's what I'm talking 'bout
Now dig this!
Ha!
Now listen, baby

You try to gimme your money
you better save it, babe
Save it for your rainy day

I have only one burning desire
Let me stand next to your fire
Let me stand next to your fire
