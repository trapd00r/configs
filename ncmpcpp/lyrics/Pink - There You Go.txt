Please don't come around talkin' bout that you love me,
Cause that love shit just aint for me,
I don't wanna hear that you adore me
And I know that all you're doing is running your mind games,
Don't you know that game peeps game?
So your best bet is to be straight with me

So you say you wanna talk, let's talk
If you won't talk I'll walk, yeah it's like that
Got a new man, he's waiting out back
Now what, whatcha think bout that, bout that?
Now when I say I'm through, I'm through
Basically I'm through with you
Whatcha' wanna say?
Had to have it your way, had to play games
Now you're begging me to stay

There you go, lookin' pitiful
Just because I let you go
There you go, talkin' bout you want me back
Sometimes it's bez like that, so
There you go, talkin' bout you miss me so,
that you love me so, Why I let you go?
there you go, cause your lies got old
Look at you, there you go!

Please don't come around talkin' bout how you changed
How you said goodbye to what's her name
All it sounds like to me is new game
And I was right when I thought I'd be much better off without you
Had to get myself from 'round you,
Cause my life was all about you

So you say you wanna talk, I don't
Say you wanna change, I won't
Yeah it's like that
Had your chance, won't take it back
Now what, whatcha think bout that, bout that?
and When I say I'm through, I'm through
Basically I'm through with you
Whatcha' wanna say?
Had to have it your way, had to play games
Now you're begging me to stay

There you go, lookin' pitiful
Just because I let you go
There you go, talkin' bout you want me back
Sometimes it's bez like that, so
There you go, talkin' bout you miss me so,
that you love me so, Why I let you go?
there you go, cause your lies got old
Look at you, there you go!

Oooh, don't you wish you could turn the hands of time?
Don't you wish that you still were mine?
Don't you wish I'd take you back?
Don't you wish that things were simple like that?
Didn't miss a good thing til' it's gone,
But I knew it wouldn't be long
Til' you came running back, missing my love THERE YOU GO!!!

There you go, lookin' pitiful
Just because I let you go
There you go, talkin' bout you want me back
Sometimes it's bez like that, so
There you go, talkin' bout you miss me so,
that you love me so, Why I let you go?
there you go, cause your lies got old
Look at you, there you go!
