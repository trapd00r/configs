Remembering me, discover and see
All over the world, she's known as a girl
To those who are free, their minds shall be keep
Forgotten as the past, 'cause history will last

God is a girl, wherever you are
Do you believe it, can you receive it
God is a girl, whatever you say
Do you believe it, can you receive it
God is a girl, however you live
Do you believe it, can you receive it
God is a girl, she's only a girl
Do you believe it, can you receive it? 

She wants to shine, forever in time
She is so driven, she's always mine
Clearly and free, she wanted to be
A part of the future, a girl like me
There is a sky, illuminating us
Someone is out there that we truly trust
There is a rainbow for you and me
A beautiful sunrise, eternally

God is a girl, wherever you are
Do you believe it, can you receive it
God is a girl, whatever you say
Do you believe it, can you receive it
God is a girl, however you live
Do you believe it, can you receive it
God is a girl, she's only a girl
Do you believe it, can you receive it?
