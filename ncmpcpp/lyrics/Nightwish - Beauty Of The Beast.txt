[Long Lost Love:]

Trees have dropped their leaves,
Clouds their waters
All this burden is killing me

Distance is covering your way,
Tears your memory
All this beauty is killing me

Oh, do you care,
I still feel for you
Oh, so aware,
What should be lost is there

I fear I will never
Never find anyone
I know my greatest pain is yet to come
Will we find each other in the dark
My long lost love

[One More Night To Live:]

Oh, do you care,
I still feel for you
Oh, so aware,
What should be lost is there (x3)

Safely away from the world
In a dream, timeless domain
A child, dreamy eyed,
Mother's mirror, father's pride

I wish I could come back to you
Once again feel the rain
Falling inside me
Cleaning all that I've become

My home is far but the rest it lies so close
With my long lost love under the black rose
You told I had the eyes of a wolf
Search them and find the beauty of the beast

All of my songs can only be composed of the greatest of pains
Every single verse can only be born of the greatest of wishes
I wish I had one more night to live

A saint blessed me, drank me deeply
Spitting out the misery in me
Still a sinner rapes a thousand saints
Sharing the same hell with me

Sanest choice in this insane world:
Beware the beast but enjoy the feast he offers (x2)

All of my songs can only be composed of the greatest of pains
Every single verse can only be born of the greatest of wishes
I wish I had one more night to live

[Christabel:]

"Oh, sweet Christabel
Share with me your poem
For I know now, I'm a puppet on this silent stage show
I'm but a poet who failed his best play
A Dead Boy, who failed to write an ending to each of his poems"
