Been hidin' out and layin' low 
It's nothing new to me 
Well, you can always find a place to go
If you can keep your sanity

They break down the doors and they rape my rights but
They won't touch me 
They scream and yell and fight all night
You can't tell me

I lose my head, I close my eyes 
They won't touch me 
'Cause I got somethin' 've been buildin' up inside 
For so fuckin' long 

They're out ta get me
They won't catch me
I'm fuckin' innocent
They won't break me

Sometimes it's easy to forget where you're goin'
Sometimes it's harder to leave
And ev'rytime you think you know just what you're doin'
That's when your troubles exceed 

They push me in a corner just to get me to fight but
They won't touch me
They preach and yell and fight all night
You can't tell me 

I lose my head, I close my eyes 
They won't touch me 
'Cause I got somethin' I've been buildin' up inside 
I'm already gone

They're out ta get me
They won't catch me
'Cause I'm innocent
They won't break me

No, no
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, oh, no, no, no
Let me see you try

Some people got a chip on their shoulder
And some would say it was me
But I didn't buy that fifth of whiskey that you gave me
So I'd be quick to disagree

They're out ta get me 
They won't catch me 
I'm fuckin' innocent 
They won't break me

They're out ta get me 
They won't catch me 
'Cause I'm innocent 
So you can suck me 

Take that one to heart
