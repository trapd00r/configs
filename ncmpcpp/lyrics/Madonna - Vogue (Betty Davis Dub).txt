Strike a pose 
Strike a pose 
Vogue, vogue, vogue 
Vogue, vogue, vogue 

Look around everywhere you turn is heartache
It's everywhere that you go (look around)
You try everything you can to escape
The pain of life that you know (life that you know)

When all else fails and you long to be 
Something better than you are today 
I know a place where you can get away 
It's called a dance floor, and here's what it's for, so 

Come on, vogue 
Let your body move to the music (move to the music)
Hey, hey, hey 
Come on, vogue 
Let your body go with the flow (go with the flow) 
You know you can do it 

All you need is your own imagination 
So use it that's what it's for (that's what it's for) 
Go inside, for your finest inspiration
Your dreams will open the door (open up the door) 

It makes no difference if you're black or white 
If you're a boy or a girl 
If the music's pumping it will give you new life 
You're a superstar, yes, that's what you are, you know it 

Come on, vogue 
Let your body groove to the music (move to the music)
Hey, hey, hey 
Come on, vogue 
Let your body go with the flow (go with the flow)
You know you can do it 

Beauty's where you find it 
Not just where you bump and grind it 
Soul is in the musical 
That's where I feel so beautiful 
Magical, life's a ball 
So get up on the dance floor 

Come on, vogue 
Let your body move to the music (move to the music)
Hey, hey, hey 
Come on, vogue 
Let your body go with the flow (go with the flow) 
You know you can do it 

Vogue, (Vogue) 
Beauty's where you find it (move to the music) 
Vogue, (Vogue) 
Beauty's where you find it (go with the flow)

Let your body move to the music 
Oooh, you've got to just
Let your body go with the flow 
Oooh, you've got to
