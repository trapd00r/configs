I'm getting tired of waitin' around
I feel like I'm always trackin' you down
I don't wanna point my finger at you
But there's something you're forgettin'
Here's what you better do, you better

Chorus:

Think of me
I know you want to baby
Think of me
It won't be long before you
Think of me
'Cause I'll be gone and then you'll
Think of me

You walk in and you see me cryin'
You apologize say you lost track of time
I'm not gonna cry anymore
You're gonna lose me too if you don't
Know what's good for you, you better

(chorus)

Tell me what I did to you to make you
Treat me so badly
If you wanna see me anymore
If you don't wanna see me walking out the door you better

(chorus)

Stop wastin' all my time
You know it could have been so fine
Hey boy I'm waitin' on a sign
Don't you know there's someone else
Stop thinking of yourself

(chorus)
