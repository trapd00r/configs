I've got the money, I've got the place
You've got the figure, you've got the face
Let's get together, the two of us
Over a glass of champagne

I've got the music, I've got the lights
You've got the figure full of delights
Let's get together the two of us
Over a glass of champagne

I've been waiting much too long
For this moment to come along
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

We'll drink a glass of champagne

I've been thinking night and day (night and day)
For this moment to be this way
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

I've got position, I've got the name
You've got the power to drive me insane
Let's get together, the two of us
Over a glass of champagne

I've been waiting much too long (much too long)
For this moment to come along
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

We'll drink a glass of champagne

Let's get together, the two of us
Over a glass of champagne
Let's get together, the two of us
Over a glass of champagne
Let's get together, the two of us
Over a glass of champagne
Let's get together, the two of us
Over a glass of champagne
