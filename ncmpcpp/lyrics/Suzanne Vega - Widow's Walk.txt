Consider me a widow, boys
And I will tell you why
It's not the man
But it's the marriage that was drowned

So I walk the walk
And wait with watchful eye up to the sky
Looking for a kind of vessel
I have never found

Though I saw it splinter
I keep looking out to sea
Like a dog with little sense
I keep returning

To the very area
Where I did see the thing go down
As if there's something at the site
I should be learning

That line is the horizon
We watch the wind and set the sail
But save ourselves when all omens
Point to fail

And if I tell the truth
Then I would have to tell you this
Though I grieve and believe
I feel it truly

But I knew the ship was empty
By the time it hit the rocks
'Cause we could not hold on
When fate became unruly

So consider me a widow, boys
And I have told you why
Does the weather say
A better day is nearing?

I'll set my house in order now
And wait upon the will
'Cause it's clear that I need
Better skill in steering

That line is the horizon
We watch the wind and set the sail
But save ourselves when all omens
Point to fail

That line is the horizon
We watch the wind and set the sail
But save ourselves when all omens
Point to fail
