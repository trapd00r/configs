*Mariah and Jay-Z*
Yeah, Aight, let's go
Gimme your love( 16x)
Hey, you gotta bounce to this like this
You're almost kinda watching this
Uh-huh
Whoo oo oo
Escape

*Mariah*
Oh you look so good
I don't wanna let go
And although I should
I can't leave you alone
'Cause your so disarming
I'm caught-up in the midst
of you and I can not resist at all
(Chorus 1):
Boy you wanna do
The things you want me too
The way I used to do
Could you love me baby
Holding me feelin' you
Could you go and break my heart?
(Chorus 2):
Heartbreaker you've got the best of me
but I just keep on coming back excessivly
Oh why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
you'd go and break my heart

(Gimme your love)--8x

It's a shame to be
so euphoric and weak
when you smile at me
and you tell me the things
that you know are stated
to relinquish my love to you
but I can not resist at all

(Chorus 1)
(Chrous 2)

*Jay-Z*
OK, Cool. Aight
Yo
She wanna shop wit Jay, play box wit Jay
She wanna pillowfight in the middle of the night
She wanna drive my Benz with five of her friends
She wanna creep past the block, spyin' again
She wanna roll wit Jay, chase skeeos away
She wanna fight wit lame chicks, blow my day
She wanna respect the rest, kick me to the curb
if she find one strand a hair longer than hers
She wanna make love in the Jacuzzi
Rub up in the movies
Access to the old crib, keys to da newbie
She wanna answer the phone
tatoo her arm
last one I got her sent it back to her mom
She call me Heartbreaker
when we apart it makes her wanna piece of paper,
scribble down "I hate ya"
But she know she love Jay because
she love everything Jay say Jay does, and ah...

(Chorus 2)
(Chorus 2)
