[And we go by the runners]

I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from

I do it for the hood 'cause the hood told me I could

If the they ain't run, you don't stress
Tell them niggas that we the best

Fuck the best, we run this game
Kanye West, Khaled and Pain

If you could, you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard
But I won't let you get to me
You should already thinkin I'm-a go hard
If you were as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in yo' yard
Makin' money ain't shit to me
This in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go
You got another way to live, you gots to go on
I am gettin' it in until the end
I got to go, go, go, go hard

Kanye West
I go the hardest
Flow so retard
I'm disgusted with myself
I mean, ughh, where do I start?
First I stand around and vomit
Then I shit up on it
Fuck the beat up so bad
Won't nobody get up on it
I flow so sick
Nigga, how sick
Sea sick
Got your hand out, don't look at me, bitch
You lookin' at who made me rich
You lookin' at who made me rich
I have some wins, some losses
Just a life of a goddamn boss's with the top off
Lookin' for a girl with a ass as fat as tracy roslet[? ]
This is no bad as it get
Dope as a motherfuckin' acid trip
Fly as 57 passengers
This finna be another classic bitch
Everybody know I got if you want it then get at it
But I ain't gon' have
No, I ain't gon' have it

If you could, you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me
You should already thinkin' I'm-a go hard
If you were as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in yo' yard
Makin' money ain't shit to me
This in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go
You got another way to live, you gots to go on
I am gettin' it in until the end
I got to go, go, go, go hard

Kanye West
I ain't ever been scurred
Never been a type to bite my words
When I came up, y'all gave me shit
Now I'm finna make y'all eat them turds
Always said what the fuck I felt
Gon' head spit that murder I wrote
Man, I don't care what you felt
Fuck you, nigga, I know I'm dope
Dope like I'm comin' to get my all
Felt like I had to play the fly on the wall
Felt like niggas was stuntin' on me
Funny how I'm flyer than them all
Now I'm at the top, ain't nowhere to go now
Instead of me, she gon' go down
Maybe I would've slowed down if I knew what I knew now
I'm scooby, I know I'm dumb
It could get fuckin' old but it's good, I'm young
But my heart get cold as the hood I'm from
Tell me what it take to be number one
I guess it's gon' be what it's gon' be
But here's one thing you got to hear
I'm-a tell you like George Bush told me
Fuck y'all niggas, I'm out of here

If you could, you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me
You should already thinkin' I'm-a go hard
If you were as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in yo' yard
Makin' money ain't shit to me
This in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go
You got another way to live, you gots to go on
I am gettin' it in until the end
I got to go, go, go, go hard
