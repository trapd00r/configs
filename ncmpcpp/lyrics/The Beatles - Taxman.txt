One, two, three, four (for you, nineteen for me)
One, two (one, two, three, four)

Let me tell you how it will be
There's one for you, nineteen for me
'Cos I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman

Should five per cent appear too small
Be thankful I don't take it all
'Cos I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman

(If you drive a car—car)
I'll tax the street
(If you try to sit—sit)
I'll tax your seat
(If you get too cold—cold)
I'll tax the heat
(If you take a walk—walk)
I'll tax your feet
Taxman

'Cos I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman

Don't ask me what I want it for
(Ha, ha, Mr. Wilson)
If you don't want to pay some more
(Ha, ha, Mr. Heath)
'Cos I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman

Now my advice for those who die
(Taxman)
Declare the pennies on your eyes
(Taxman)
'Cos I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman
And you're working for no one but me (Taxman)
