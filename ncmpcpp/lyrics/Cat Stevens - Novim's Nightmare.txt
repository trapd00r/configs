Once I had a dream that worried me, 
Like a drunken guillotine 
Lingering just above my head.

Why, why, why, why? 
Why was I born and I'm cursed repeatedly?
Who would know if I should die?
No one needed me.

Doo doo doo doo doo ...

Dark and empty was the place to which I'd come. 
Cold and silent was the house my name was on. 
Nine rooms and a tomb in every one. 
So dark and empty was the place to which I'd come. 

All at once my bones began to change. 
I was tall and young again, 
Sweet as rain falling on the snow. 
Who, who, who, who? 
Who is he?  Who am I? 
And what laid in between? 
How can I say goodbye? 
No one let me in.

Can't see no need for Nine no more 
Now it's too late to open the door. 

La la la la la ...
