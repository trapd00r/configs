I am an emigre
I write to Germany
In foreign words
A tongue of actuality
Coated in grey gloves
To Germany with love
A war between the wars
To Germany with love

I am an emigre
I write to Germany
In foreign words
A tongue of actuality
Coated in grey gloves
Coated in grey gloves
To Germany with love
To Germany with love
A war between the wars
A war between the wars
A war between the wars
A war between the wars

Triumph over by-gone sorrow
Can in unity be won
Let them all persue this purpose
'Til reality is gone
I am an unexpected spy
From the outside of my eye
Translate it first then comprehend
I'm here indeed but there I stand

I write to Germany
I write to Germany
To Germany with love
Germany with love
I write to Germany
I write to Germany
To Germany with love
Germany with love

This is the turn of colours
All real but still unseen
There is no more decision
'Cause there's too much in between
Let us build a nightmare nation
Learn and work as never yet
That this cold new generation
Faith in its own fears beget

Here comes the modern rat
Here comes the terror-squad
Ours is the salt of wisdom
Here we come all dressed in black
From the ruins risen slowly
To the future turned we stand
Flourish in this blessing glory
Flourish, German fatherland

I write to Germany
I write to Germany
To Germany with love
Germany with love
I write to Germany
I write to Germany
Germany with love
Germany with love
I write to Germany (I write to Germany)
I write to Germany (I write to Germany)

I write to Germany (I write to Germany)

I write to Germany (I write to Germany)
I write in Germany
