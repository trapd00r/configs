I know all the times were hard 
I know that you've been feeling down 
If you only knew how I'm feeling for you 
If I could take your pain 
I wish that I could wash it all away 
If you only knew how I'm feeling 

Verse 1 - Vinnie Paz
Mommy, I'm sorry if my first letter made you cry 
To be honest with you, I don't think that I want to die 
Sometimes I feel like that I'm cancerous in other's lives 
That's probably why I drink at night and sleep 'til four or five 
It's kind of hard walkin' through life with my distorted eyes 
When I was younger, I was stupid and I thought I'd thrive 
I thought a lot about everything I said in the letter 
And questioned whether or not if I was dead, you'd be better 
You think my shorty would be happy if I never met her? 
It's too late now, mommy, I could never forget her 
Could never forget how she taught me to love 
'Cause my father and my grandmother is always above 
It's glory above, you know that daddy taught me to thug 
And every time we was with nanny she'd bombard me with hugs 
Damn, I miss her, mommy, and it's hard to believe 
That I'm grown and I don't understand it, why did they leave? 

(Better to die than sleep)
(Then never wake and sleep)
(Then linger on and dare to live)
(When the soul's life is gone)
 
Chorus - Shara Worden
You've been running around for so long 
You've been hurting yourself too much 
You keep messing around with darkness 
You're the one who's losing 
You've been running around for so long 
You've been hurting yourself too much 
You keep messing around with darkness 
You're the one who's losing 

Verse 2 - Vinnie Paz
Mommy, I think that I'ma try to stick around a while 
I got a niece, and my nephews, they need me 'round a while 
I think they need me 'cause they hittin' that age 
And they ain't tryin' to speak to Lenny 'cause they spittin' they rage 
Yeah, and mommy, speakin' to Lenny, I think my brother need me 
And we Italian, so you know my mother love to feed me 
And it's the little things you do for me that make it worth it 
Like when I play a joint that we did and you say it's perfect 
And when Jake got knocked, you knew that I was hurt 
You told me put all of my heart in the song, and it worked 
I promised him that I'd be there when he got out the bing 
You ain't raise me to be a liar, ma, that's not my thing 
I told him that I'd hold him down the whole time that he gone 
They kept him locked inside a cage, but that's cool, 'cause he's strong 
So mommy, keep that first letter I wrote you on the low 
I think I wanna stay alive and see if I can grow

You've been running around for so long 
You've been hurting yourself too much 
You keep messing around with darkness 
You're the one who's losing 
You've been running around for so long 
You've been hurting yourself too much 
You keep messing around with darkness 
You're the one who's losing 

("You have power and money, but you are mortal 
You know you cannot escape death 
But immortality can be obtained 
The legend is always the same 
If others have succeeded in conquering death 
Why must we accept it? 
I know where the immortals live 
And how to obtain their secret 
We too must become wise men 
The elements of chemistry are many, but finite 
So are the techniques of enlightenment")
