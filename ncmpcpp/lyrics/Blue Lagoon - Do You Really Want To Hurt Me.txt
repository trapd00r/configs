Send "Do You Really Want to Hurt Me" Ringtone to your Cell Give me time 
To realise my crime 
Let me love and steal 
I have danced inside your eyes 
How can I be real 

Do you really want to hurt me 
Do you really want to make me cry 

Precious kisses 
Words that burn me 
Lovers never ask you why 
In my heart the fire's burning 
Choose my colour 
Find a star 
Precious people always tell me 
That's a step 
A step too far 

Chorus: 
Do you really want to hurt me 
Do you really want to make me cry 
Do you really want to hurt me 
Do you really want to make me cry 

Words are few 
I have spoken 
I could waste a thousand years 
Wrapped in sorrow Words are token 
Come inside and catch my tears 
You've been talking but believe me 
If its true You do not know 
This boy loves without a reason 
I'm prepared to let you go 
If it's love you want from me 
Then take it away 
Everything is not what you see 
It's over AGAIN
