No
No shapes at all
Nothing real or artificial
No energy or heat
No troughs there are no peaks
No hangover from last night
No shame in first light
No time there'll be no change
No colours to rearrange

And I
I get that feeling
When we're apart, oh
I get the teaching that I can't be without you
Without you babe
Without you

No future there is no past
No slow there is no fast
No grace with which to admire
No face there is no desire
No symmetry or peace
No sirens all police
No cameras and no phones
No photographs and no tones

And I
I get that feeling
When we're apart, oh
I get the teaching that I can't be without you
Without you babe
Without you

Come on
Hey now
Come on
Hey now
Come on
Take my heart in your hands
Come on
Hey now
Come on
Hey now
Come on
Take my heart in your hands

And I
I get that feeling
When we're apart, oh
I get the teaching that I can't be without you
Without you babe
Without you
