Now they're out takin' bets
Smokin' filter cigarettes

Since he read the Wizard of Id
He's trying to figure out what he did

If you're wrong you've got soul
If you're twenty then you're old

In our time
In our time, baby
Our own sweet time

In our time, baby
In our time
In our time, baby
In our time 
In our time, baby
In our time, yeah
In our time....
