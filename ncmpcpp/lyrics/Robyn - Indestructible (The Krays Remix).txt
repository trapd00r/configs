I'm going backwards through time at the speed of light 
I'm yours, you're mine 
Two satellites 
Not alone 
No, we're not alone 

A freeze-frame of your eye in the strobelight 
Sweat dripping down from your brow 
Hold tight 
Don't let go 
Don't you let me go 

And I never was smart with love 
I let the bad ones in and the good ones go 
But I'm gonna love you like I've never been hurt before 
I'm gonna love you like I'm indestructible 
Your love is ultramagnetic 
Not again it's taking over 
This is hardcore 
And I'm indestructible 

Hands up in the air like we don't care 
We're shooting deep into space 
And the lasers split the dark 
Cut right through the dark 

It's just us we ignore the crowd dancing 
Fall to the floor 
Beats in my heart 
Put your hands on my heart 

And I never was smart with love 

I let the bad ones in and the good ones go 
But I'm gonna love you like I've never been hurt before 
I'm gonna love you like I'm indestructible 
Your love is ultimate 
Not again it's taking over 
This is hardcore 
Ooh and I'm gonna love you like 
Like I've never been hurt before 
I'm gonna love you like I'm indestructible 
Your love is ultimate 
Not again it's taking over 
This is hardcore 
And I'm indestructible 

And I never was smart with love 
I let the bad ones in and the good ones go 
But I'm gonna love you like I've never been hurt before 
I'm gonna love you like I'm indestructible 
Your love is ultimate 
Not again it's taking over 
This is hardcore 
Ooh and I'm gonna love you like 
Like I've never been hurt before 
I'm gonna love you like I'm indestructible 
Your love is ultimate 
Not again it's taking over 
This is hardcore 
And I'm indestructible
