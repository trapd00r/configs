Your heart is not open, so I must go
The spell has been broken, I loved you so
Freedom comes when you learn to let go
Creation comes when you learn to say no

You were my lesson, I had to learn
I was your fortress, you had to burn
Pain is a warning that something's wrong
I pray to God that it won't be long
Do you wanna go higher

There's nothing left to try
There's no place left to hide
There's no greater power
Than the power of goodbye

Your heart is not open, so I must go
The spell has been broken, I loved you so
You were my lesson, I had to learn
I was your fortress

There's nothing left to lose
There's no more heart to bruise
There's no greater power 
Than the power of goodbye

Learn...to...say...good...bye
I yearn...to...say...good...bye

There's nothing left to try
There's no more places to hide
There's no greater power
Than the power of goodbye

There's nothing left to lose
There's no more heart to bruise
There's no greater power
Than the power of good-bye
