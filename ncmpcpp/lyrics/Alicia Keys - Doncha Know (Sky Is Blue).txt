If you think the sky is fallin'
Your commin' undone
All the pieces crumble
You're on the run

All the wrong you've taken
All the rules your breakin'
Doncha know the silent truth is
It comes back to you

Doncha know the sky is blue
Can't you see the sun is breaking through
Have a little faith in you
Doncha know the sky is blue

Everytime you walk out that door
Cursing the sky
Feeling like you've been cheated
Ripped from inside

Doncha know the sky is blue
Can't u see the sun is breaking through
Have a little faith in you
Doncha know the sky is blue

Come on..

Nanananana...

Doncha know the sky is blue
Docnha know the sky is blue

Have a, have a little faith in you
Doncha know the sky is blue
Doncha know the sky is blue
Hey!
Doncha know the sky is blue
Come on
The sky is blue
Said: sky, sky
I'm telling you the sky is blue
Believe it 
Woo hoo
Doncha know the sky sky sky sky
Hey hey..
Nananaaa...
