I got some troubles but they wont last
I'm gonna lay right down here in the grass
And pretty soon all my troubles will pass
'Cause I'm in shu shu shu,
Shu shu shu,
Shu shu shu shu shu shu Sugar Town.

I never had a dog that liked me some
I never had a friend or wanted one
So I just lay back and laugh at the sun
'Cause I'm in shu shu shu,
Shu shu shu,
shu shu shu shu shu shu Sugar Town.


Yesterday it rained in Tennessee
I heard it also rained in Talahassee
But not a drop fell on little old me
'Cause I was in shu shu shu,
Shu shu shu,
shu shu shu shu shu shu Sugar Town.

If I had a million dollars or ten
I'd give it to your world and then
You'd go away and let me spend
My life in shu shu shu,
Shu shu shu,
shu shu shu shu shu shu Sugar Town.

La la la...
