Send "If I Survive (Jerome Sydenham remix)" Ringtone to your Cell Breathing shallow,
I'm slipping away.
Hanging in the gallows,
I'm starting to pray.
How careful it was planned to do away with me;
So kill me if you can,
But words won't make be bleed.
So what if I survive,
And live to tell the truth?
Imagine my surprise,
To find me living and so very much alive!
I'll find a new life and hide,
If I survive.
But I swear you're going down if I survive!

I'll find a new life and hide if I survive.
I'll find my own place in time if I survive.
I'll learn to forget the crime if I survive...
But I swear you're going down if I survive!

If I survive I'll tell on you.

I'll find a new life and hide if I survive.
I'll find my own place in time if I survive.
I'll learn to forget the crime if I survive...
But I swear you're going down if I survive!
