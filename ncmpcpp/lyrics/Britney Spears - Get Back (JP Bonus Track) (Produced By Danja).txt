The one and only Britney
Yeah, yeah
You ready, B? Huh.
I think you ready, yeah

1, 2, 3, 4
Uh

Oh no, here we go
Catch me if you can, don't move too slow
I'm on another level, can you feel my flow?
See how good when I'm on the floor
Wonder if you're ready for the zing that I got
I told you before that I'mma keep it hot
See how it is when I walk up in the spot
Standing in a line
Ha, I think not

I came to party baby, you might think I'm crazy
By the way I'm moving to the beat
You're standing on the wall
What you come here for?
You're gonna feel the heat, dancing next to me

If you can't take it back, get back (get back)
Get back (get back)
Get back (get back)
If you can't take it back, get back (get back)
Get back (get back)
Get back (get back)
If you can't take it back, get back (get back)
Get back (get back)

If you can't take it back, get back (get back)
Get back (get back)
Get back (get back)
If you can't take it back

DJ spin it back
Know that I like it when you do it like that
Eyes on my waist, boy you better think fast
Got that kind of body, make you wanna spend cash
Shake it like you see them do it in the video
Ladies on the floor, let me see you get low
Fellas at the bar, won't you spend a little dough?
This is how I do it when I'm tearing up the floor

I came to party baby, you might think I'm crazy
By the way I'm moving to the beat
You're standing on the wall
What you come here for?
You're gonna feel the heat dancing next to me

If you can't take it back, get back (get back)
Get back (get back)
Get back (get back)
If you can't take it back, get back (get back)
Get back (get back)
Get back (get back)
If you can't take it back, get back (get back)
Get back (get back)
Get back (get back)
If you can't take it back, get back (get back)
Get back (get back)
Get back (get back)
If you can't take it back

Watch me
You like it
Well I've got it
1, 2, 3, 4

Would you like it if I tease you, get you really hot
Watch me turn around then let me show you what I got
Baby if you're ready, won't you step up to the plate
Don't be scared of how I'm moving, boy don't play it safe

Let me see you move
Let me see you dance
Let me see you bounce
Danja, bring it back

If you can't take it back, get back (get back)
