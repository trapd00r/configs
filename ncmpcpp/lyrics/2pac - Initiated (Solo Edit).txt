Live in this muthafucker, Thug Pound Biotch
Kurupt, Daz, Makaveli, Idi, Kastro, Hussein
You know bitch the whole muthafuckin' clique.
We gon' hit yo' ass up. You know where we comin' from
Death Row BIOTCH  hahaha Ay yo Kurupt
you first to blast nigga and you know how we do it on
the Westside nigga  
We ballers for real...

(Kurupt)
For real I got it bought you the blue steel
cowards hit the panic button
thinkin' that it was what it wadn't
shit's hectic the bomb Vietnam rhyme Don
with the semi-auto fracture your torso to ya spine
the back cracker smack you with
my verbals & graphic grammar
My verbal murder strech from Alaska to Alabama
get touched by my Arm & Hammer
all across the planet niggas crumble like granite
from Tahiti to the Mid-Atlantic
probable cause to get hit shit
niggas best get physically & mentally fit
Show ya hoe I ignore for real & I can tell
on the DL I got an Indecent Proposal for her (biotch)
mashin' in a Ford Explorer hell hound host the horror
escape from the Box Pandora somethin' for ya
get rocked by my midnight Glock
sniper through sound vocal rival to invade the block
Fuckin' bitch paid the price of a snitch the
?Nicki Scarful? comin' through the bus death
spreads through camps like ?Parvul?
Young Gotti Kurupt & C with the dope & the green weed
Indeed I'm out to get high & supply
what you need Mr. Postman
comin' through with all the mail What you need?
I got for sale on the stairwell to Hell


(Fatal Hussein)
I wake up sparkin' to get wild on the streets
barkin' & playas drinkin' kegs til y'all niggas beg Martin
you labelled Paw nervous no I do this job dirty
Donna Karan New York call it Fatal Dogg New Jersey
niggas ain't seen time I travel courts & dream crime
my room like the million dollar bill folded with green blinds
chairs is a hundreds for shams I run that hole in quickies
Dollar bills is 'intendos the windows is folded fifties
Y'all old cops lost it drinkin' the scotch barfless
I don't like movies so I hit up the Box Office
you the softest I'm takin' ya honies they Telly pieces
wearin' my fuckin' dick around they neck like Kelly leashes
My boys & me is poison we don't get along equal
Fight each other like brothers it's all good we strong people
more strain on the brain & the pain I deal with
ill with nasty niggas my whole crew on some real shit
for real bitch the steel clique I bill with menaces
ya number one nemesis paragraphical like Genesis

(Pac)
Stupid muthafuckas Outlaw Immortal Bitch
Dogg Pound Thug Life you know how we Fuckin' do this shit!
You stupid muthafuckas don't get me...

Now take a look inside my mind
that Pen' time made me rise but still I rise
Cause my Ambitionz Az A Ridah like land mines
Lyrics turn niggas into smithereens
music so lethal turn coliseums to murder scenes
I'm Makaveli the Don is what they tell me
I'm armed I'm droppin' niggas like bombs
get in that ass like a thong
Picture a felon in ya presence
takin' bustas back to the Essence
tellin' my people peep my lethal message
visions of me gettin' money got me in mash mode
murderous motives for niggas stoppin' my cash flow
you can't fight it nigga let go
Witness the sound made ya bitch ass
bow down to Death Row
Mama these niggas got me fightin' these 3 Strikes
showin' up in court fuck what you thought it's three nights
I put the game down first put my niggas up on it
now we Amerikaz Most Wanted feel that

(Kastro) 
Since my Only Fear of Death is Mama cryin' for help
& OG Daddy wanna ride when I know
he ain't got shit else since I'm his only soldier
Nobody else gonna roll for me & I know
without the Row & Immortal Outlaw (Ay K)
I'll be forgotten for sho
plus this Thug Life it got me livin'
Initiated playa hated without givin' a single fuck
why they dangling baby all on my nuts
I be singling fingering bitches to fuck

(Pac)
Bitches is wild niggas is lame
I hung around with real niggas got exposed to the game
muthafuckas actin' crazy bustin' me in the jaw
Initiated as an Outlaw hahahaha (yeah muthafucka)

(Daz)
Now a mission ain't a mission if nobody rides
and a mission ain't a mission if nobody dies
and a mission ain't complete if the enemy don't sleep
enemies rest in peace deceased fuckin' with me
I got to 'complish a goal I'm out seekin' gold
expose the strap gotta let off the cousin rough & raw
Never fell to my knees for shit cause I demand shit
with this Daz Dillinger drillin' ya for ya shit
on the streets for the sixth time in & out for the crime
I rates crimes add up in food stamp dollars & dimes
I'm slippin' slidin' fucked up nigga whuttup
In the cut flossin' like a muthafucka whuttup
beside all being now tell me where ya comin' from
that ain't where I see thangs & nigga what's the outcome

(Idi Amin)
For so many days & so many ways we been duckin' strays
they delivers but still we some Bad Boy killers
Hold the scrillas I dump in you niggas' livers
then watch ya body shiver & ya mama quiver
from the way you just got lit up
Hit up the Westside on my way out
y'all whole crew should've knew it was on
from Makaveli's first day out now y'all gettin' played out
& laid out for public display on this day
y'all niggas is historay cause the whole crew is bitch to me
listen to me Idi How many of y'all can see me?
Cause I'll tack that ass like A's attack DC
Believe me 'cause although now I'm just a young stolder
I'm soon to be a gun holder Initiate to the clique
with a left to my lip now the fight's over

(gunshots 'till end)
