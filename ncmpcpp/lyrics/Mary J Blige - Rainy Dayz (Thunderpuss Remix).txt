Until the sun shines and I see your face
Smile at me, smile at me

{Mary}
We were always livin so crazy and sexy and cool
And we began to love it (began to love it)
Watchin all of the heartache and pain of the world
And thinkin nothin of it (thinkin nothin of it)
And baby I got love for you 
And I know that you got me, baby
But everytime the sun shines bright
It gets so cloudy

It's just those rainy days
Spend a lifetime tryin to wash away
Until the sun come out and shines again
Smile for me, smile for me

{Ja}
All of those rainy days

Yea baby
Sometimes the Rule don't mind the rain
It kinda feels like I'm drownin in the Lords pain
Until the sun comes out and shines again
Smile, and give me reason to keep believin
That everything ain't misleadin
And I, kiss the clouds on them rainy days
And, smile for you when ya skys are gray
Babe, cuz I'm a tear drop away from cryin
And a few shots away from dyin
Dear Lord, would you shower my pain
Let it rain, let it rain on me
While I cherish the air I breathe
I'm an angel, that can't soar, can't fly
And I, mastered it Lord knows why

I feel like an angel
With my broken wings
So I can soar again
Lord let me in
Baby through all the passion the pain and the hurt
I feel like I'm fallin, yeah

Makin clothes for all of those that
Spread love
And for those who can't take it
Stand up
Baby, we gonna make it
In the words of Marvin Gaye
War is not the answer
