Send "The Right Time (radio edit)" Ringtone to your Cell This is the right time
Once in a lifetime

So I find it hard to sleep
Don't you know
The sun is shinin' in my window
Life's in flow
Makin' music in the morning
Laughter's light
Creativity touches
In full flight

This is the right time, once in a lifetime

Keep it going, let's not lose it
Feel the flow
Ohhhh, flying free in a fantasy
With you I'll go

This is the right time
Once in a lifetime

Now something has entered my mind
Shattering all of my thoughts
It's no good, it's just one big waste of my time
But what can I do to recall...
