No time for the complexities of conversation
No time smiles, no time for knowing
No time for the intricacies of explanation
No time for sharing, even less for showing

If I could
I'd slow the whole world down
I'd bring it to its knees
I'd stop it spinning round
But as it is
I'm climbing up an endless wall

No time at all
No time this time
No time at all
No time this time

No time for a quick kiss at the railway station
No time for a suitcase, sandwich and a morning paper
Only time for time tables, calls and transportation
No time to think no time to dare

If I could
I'd slow the whole world down
I'd bring it to its knees
I'd stop it spinning round
But as it is
I'm climbing up an endless wall

No time at all
No time this time
No time at all
No time this time

If I could
I'd slow the whole world down
I'd bring it to its knees
I'd stop it spinning round
But as it is
I'm climbing up an endless wall

No time at all
No time this time
