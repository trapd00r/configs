I cannot sleep - the night is young
I cannot eat - I want some fun
I pick you up - Route 66
Life gives me the kick
I cannot live - I love this life
I cannot die - can I survive
I cannot breathe - without your love
I can't get enough


Refrain
Refrain It's the last exit to Brooklyn
New York City, oh is waiting
You're a new boy, you're a party guy
Baby let's dance, and have some joy
West coast, east side, that is the place where
New York, L.A. I wanna live there
New York City boy, L.A. party girl
Baby let's dance, in a brand new world

4 - 6 - 0 - 1 - East Avenue
Why does my heart - beats just for you
I cannot give - you more I'll give
Baby please forgive
I cannot tell - you thousant lies
I have the love - right in my eyes
The night is young - I want your heart
Baby can we start

In between
Hold on, baby, baby hold on
Party up, party up, party up, baby, party up, party up

I can't believe - oh what I see
I can't control - it's extacy
I can't explain - oh what I feel
My dream comes so real
I cannot leave - your love alone
I cannot go - I'm not a stone
I cannot say - good bye to you
When my dream comes true
