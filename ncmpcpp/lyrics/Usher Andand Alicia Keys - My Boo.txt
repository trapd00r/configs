Send "Stranger" Ringtone to your Cell [Chorus]
Say you'll never give away your heart again
I'll be knocking until you let me in
I know you told me, you rather be lonely
You do even know, that's why I no longer want to be a stranger

[Verse 1]
Sorry you put you trust in others and they let you down (let you down)
And all the the secrets and the unknown evidence now open up that you found
Cry your self to sleep so many nights saying you never again
I'm not the one you hold it against baby it's not my place

[Bridge]
Girl you independent as hell and doing by your self (but)
What you gone do when the night time gets cold (when it get cold) (what you told me)
I know you told me, you rather be lonely, you don't even know me
I ain't moving out the way for nothing (I'm sorry) (Cause you say you will never...)

[Chorus]
Give away your heart again 
I'll be knock tell you let me in (I know you told me)
You rather be lonely
You don't even know me, that's why I no long want to be a stranger
What I gotta do
What I gotta do 
What I gotta do

What I gotta do
What I gotta do 
What I gotta do

[Verse 2]
Stuck inside no matter how hard you try to forget (to forget)
Don't you wish there was a button we can reset (and make it easy)
But you can't take back the decision that you made to love
I know it one that you regret and and not to proud of (no) (because you keep saying)

[Bridge]
Girl you independent as hell and doing by your self (but)
What you gone do when the night time gets cold (when the night-time get cold) (what you told me)
I know you told me, you rather be lonely, you don't know me
I ain't moving out the way for nothing (I'm sorry) (Cause you say you will never...)

[Chorus]
Give away your heart again 
I'll be knock tell you let me in (I know you told me)
You rather be lonely
You don't even know me, that's why I no long want to be a stranger
What I gotta do
What I gotta do 
What I gotta do

What I gotta do
What I gotta do 
What I gotta do

[Break]

I remember the break up and the condition that my heart was in (but)
I was looking surrender (no no) I got to be stronger 
There nothing that time can't heal
Girl I know your scarred
All I ask is chance to come in and do my part
There's nothing be fear and you been holding on since
Too under pressure and I see you sinking in.... (Cause you say you will never...)

[Chorus]
Give away your heart again 
I'll be knock tell you let me in (I know you told me)
You rather be lonely
You don't even know me, that's why I no long want to be a stranger
What I gotta do
What I gotta do 
What I gotta do

What I gotta do
What I gotta do 
What I gotta do
