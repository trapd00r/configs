I see your sister in her Sunday dress
She's out to please, she pouts her best
She's out to take, no need to try
She's ready to make

It's so easy, easy
When everybody's tryin' to please me baby
It's so easy, easy
When everybody's tryin' to please me

Cars are crashin' every night
I drink and drive, everything's in sight
I make the fire, but I miss the firefight
I hit the bull's eye every night

Now it's so easy, easy
When everybody's tryin' to please me baby
Yeah, it's so easy, easy
When everybody's tryin' to please me

So easy
But nothin' seems to please me
It all fits so right
When I fade into the night
See me hit you, you fall down, huh

I see you standin' there
You think you're so cool
Why don't you just
Fuck off?

You get nothin' for nothin'
If that's what ya do
Turn around bitch, I got a use for you
Besides you ain't got nothin' better to do
And I'm bored

It's so easy, easy
When everybody's tryin' to please me baby
It's so easy, easy
When everybody's tryin' to please me

So easy
But nothin' seems to please me
It all fits so right
When I fade into the night

So come with me
Don't ask me where 'cause I don't know
I'll try to please you
I ain't got no money but it goes to show

It's so easy
So fuckin' easy
It's so easy
So damn easy

It's so easy
Oh, so fuckin' easy
It's so easy
Hell, so easy

It's so easy
So fuckin' easy
It's so easy
Yeah
