It all seemed perfect
But there are moments when I feel nothing at all
Same as always
Now it's repeating itself all over again

Night after night you say you move on
Tomorrow, tomorrow
Now, what's holding you back?
I don't know, I don't know
Night after night you say you move on
Tomorrow, tomorrow
Now, what's holding you back?
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know

Don't feel sorry
'Cause there's no reason for us to fight any more
Tears are coming, and years are going
I hope we'll learn something

Night after night you say you move on
Tomorrow, tomorrow
Now, what's holding you back?
I don't know, I don't know
Night after night you say you move on
Tomorrow, tomorrow
Now, what's holding you back?
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know

Night after night you say you move on
Tomorrow, tomorrow
Now, what's holding you back?
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Night after night you say you move on
Tomorrow, tomorrow
Now, what's holding you back?
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
