Hey, let's kick it
Stop, just lick it
Let you start it
'Cause 'cause it's so easy
You like it my way
And I know it
So let's do it
Do it do it real good
Ha, it's sweaty
Now, I'm ready
Just take it off
Cause cause you tease me
I like it that way
And I know it
Do it do it real good

OOOO
This song is not for you lovers
Woo-oo-oo
Don't stop push it now
And I will give it all to you
Don't just stop now
And try to give it all up

Hey, let's kick it
