Uhh what you got - I got the skills to pay the bills 
I'm mike d and I'm bustin' out trap kits 
The time has come so I'm going to rap this 
You Rip Van Winkle now you're gonna wake up 
MC's pick up a hobby that you're gonna take up 
On the stage I'm known to break fool 
But when I'm at the table it's the Futterman's rule 
Workin' on my game cause it's time to tax 
I'm on a crazy mission to wax Bob Mack shit 
Up to the top, 'till the very last drop 
I'm make you pay for the rhymes I take 
I'm selling sex rhymes by the pound 
You horny MC's I watch you getting around my...

Let it go down like it's supposed to be 
Words together like birds in a flock 
Agh yes rhymes on time like the hands on a clock 
Well I'm an epileptic, a skept-a-cleptic 
I'm cutting up the beats from the bear I clept it
I fucked around and then I lost my tooth 
I'm telling everybody it's the goddamned truth 
Like Dennis Coffey I'm a Scorpio 
Like my man Schneider, I'm a super ho 
Making mountains out of molehills and rockin' some mo' skills 
Butt naked beats with butt naked fills

A-wella wella wella wella welcome back 
I don't sell bullets and I don't sell crack
Rub a little oil on my neck and back 
Now listen baby doll we outta hit the sack 
The original young aboriginal 
Continued evolution of an individual well I'll tell ya 
Got so many rhymes ya know my throat is sore 
It's 1992 and still no one to vote for 
Well like my words is what I'm seeing through my own eyes 
A little vision of the truth in a world of lies 
When it comes to coming off I like to get my fill
