There's a spanner in the works, you know
You gotta step up your game to make it to the top
So go

Gotta little competition now
You're going to find it hard to cope with living on your own now
Oh oh, oh oh

Let's make this happen, girl
You gotta show the world that something good can work
And it can work for you
And you know that it will

Let's get this started girl
We're moving up, we're moving up
It's been a lot to change
But you will always get what you want

Took a little time to make it a little better
It's only going out, just one thing and another
You know, you know

And it can work for you
And you know that it will
