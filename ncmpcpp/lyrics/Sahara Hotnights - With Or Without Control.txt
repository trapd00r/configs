You've got a hold on me
You're messing up the screen
Thought it was a good idea
Dealing with the enemy

I'm losing track of time
And every step's a mile
You kill expensive hours
And leave me here uncovered

Boy, you're really messing up my mind'

With or without control
You've come to shake it all
Slow down
You've got me facing the wall
I keep moving on
On my own

And this is getting weird
You went straight to my head
Moving in circles
Spinning and sparkle

Boy, you're really messing up my mind'

With or without control
You've come to shake it all
Slow down
You've got me facing the wall
I keep moving on
On my own

C'mon, C'mon I'm waiting for the end of the show
C'mon, C'mon I'm trying hard to keep you on hold

With or without control
You've come to shake it all
Slow down
You've got me facing the wall
I keep moving on

With or without control
You've come to shake it all
Slow down
You've got me facing the wall
I keep moving on
On my own

On my own...
