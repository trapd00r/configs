I'm sitting here in the boring room 
It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon 
I'm wasting my time 
I got nothing to do 
I'm hanging around 
I'm waiting for you 
But nothing ever happens and I wonder 

I'm driving around in my car 
I'm driving too fast 
I'm driving too far 
I'd like to change my point of view 
I feel so lonely 
I'm waiting for you 
But nothing ever happens and I wonder 

I wonder how 
I wonder why 
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky 
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon-tree 
I'm turning my head up and down 
I'm turning turning turning turning turning around 
And all that I can see is just another lemon-tree 

Sing, dah...

I'm sitting here 
I miss the power 
I'd like to go out taking a shower 
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head 
I feel so tired 
Put myself into bed 
While nothing ever happens and I wonder 

Isolation is not good for me 
Isolation I don't want to sit on the lemon-tree 
I'm steppin' around in the desert of joy 
Baby anyhow I'll get another toy 
And everything will happen and you wonder 

I wonder how 
I wonder why 
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky 
And all that I can see is just another lemon-tree 
I'm turning my head up and down 
I'm turning turning turning turning turning around 
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon-tree 
Yellow, wonder, wonder 

I wonder how 
I wonder why 
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky 
And all that I can see, and all that I can see, and all that I can see 
Is just a yellow lemon-tree
