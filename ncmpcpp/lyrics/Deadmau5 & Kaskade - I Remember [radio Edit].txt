Feeling the past moving in 
Letting a new day begin 
Hold to the time that you know 
You don't have to move on to let go 

Add to the memory you keep 
Remember when you fall asleep 
Hold to the love that you know 
You don't have to give up to let go 

Remember turning on the night 
And moving through the morning light 
Remember how it was with you 
Remember how you pulled me through 

I remember
