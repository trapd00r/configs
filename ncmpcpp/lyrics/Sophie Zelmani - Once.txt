Hey you
can I breathe
if my chest is covered

Hey you
is my face making sense
Eyes can't be still
in a moment so tense

Here babe
are the notes you must play
This babe, is the procedure

Here babe
not in another way
I can assure you
that you will be okey

Once would do
once could change everything
Once could tell
and help me to clear out
some things

Once would make
no difference at all
Once or not
I've already made this fall

Hey you
make the most of the time
You've got to cross many borders

If you can't control your mind
something will happen
it's just a question of time

Oh babe
I can not concentrate
I'm here for the wrong reason

It's you who makes my knees shake
One season, then
the brakes're gonna break
