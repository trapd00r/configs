Who can catch lightnin' in a bottle, set fire to water
Comin' out the nozzle on a fire hose, flyer than swatters
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
Smash an hourglass, grab the sand, take his hands and cup 'em
Spit a rhyme to freeze the clock; take the hands of time and cuff 'em
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
There's a storm comin' that the weatherman couldn't predict
I start the bug prick, you better flea 'cause I get ticked
It's a wrap; I was down, when I was down I was kicked
I got up, I'm back to punch you to the ground, you're tricked
It's a trap; fuck my last CD, that shit's in my trash
I'll be goddamned if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
You can die in the blink of an eye, so bat your eyelashes
And keep winkin' and blowin' kisses 'cause you're flirtin' with death
I'm destroyin' your livelihood; I ain't just hurtin' your rep
I catch a flow and get goin'; no remorse I'm showin', ain't slowin' for no one
Knowin' there's nothin' you can do about it
Zeroin' on my target like a marksman, the target is you
I shut your lane down, took your spot; parked in it, too
Arsenic flow, lighter fluid, saliva—what can you do?
Go get your crew to hype you up; stand behind you like, whoo
That boy's hot enough to melt hell, burn Satan, too
Fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
So you can hate him, he don't blame you; frankly, he would, too
This game could ill-afford to lose him; how 'bout you?
Now guess who (hey), here's a clue (hey)
He came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his Nike shoe
It's in your ass (hey), he's in your ass; he's all up in your psyche, too (hey)
Now, what's his name?

Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man
Cinderella-Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man

If I had a time machine, I'd be
Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man

Music is my time machine so call me
Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man

Fuck catchin' lightnin'; he struck it; screamed "Shut up" at thunder
Then flipped the world upside down and made it rain upward
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
Rewound the future to the present, paused it, don't ask how
Fuck the past, motherfucker; he's the shit right how
He's (Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
Cinderella man, Cinder-fella, Shady Dane
Came to wrap the game up in cellophane, raise hell; from hell he came
But didn't come to bore ya with the Cinderella story
Nor did he come to do the same ol'; can't afford to be a lame-o
In this day and age and at this stage of the game
Mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly
So say bye to the old, H-I to the new, Que Sera
Consider it his last hurrah, the coup de grace; raise 'em high in the sky
Keep 'em out, time to bring the place alive
Thanks for bein' patient; I won't make no more mistakes, shit
My potatoes baked homie, the veggies on my plate can fly
My filet is smokin' weed; yeah, faggot, the stakes are high
Shit, I ain't even s'pposed to be here by the grace of God
The skin on my teeth and a hair on my nuts, I skated by
Now y'all are on thin ice with ankle weights, I'd hate to lie
How fuckin' irritated are you, how much in your face am I
And ain't shit you can do but fear it; proof is here in spirit
And I'm his spittin' image; I mirror it when I stand near it
Your pussy lyric, I cunt hear it
Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyricists?
Who (hey), here's a clue (hey)
He came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his Nike shoe
It's in your ass (hey), he's in your ass; he's all up in your psyche, too (hey)
Now, what's his name?

If I had a time machine, I'd be
