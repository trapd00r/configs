a) Your move

I've seen all good people turn their heads each day
so satisfied I'm on my way
I've seen all good people turn their heads each day
so satisfied I'm on my way

Take a straight and stronger course to the corner of
your life
Make the white queen run so fast she hasn't got time
to make you a wife

'Cause it's time, it's time in time with your time and
it's news is captured for the queen to use
Move me on to any black square
Use me anytime you want
Just remember that the goal
Is for us all to capture all we want, anywhere

Don't surround yourself with yourself
Move on back two squares
Send an instant karma to me
Initial it with loving care
Don't surround yourself

'Cause it's time, it's time in time with your time and
it's news is captured for the queen to use

Diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit didda
