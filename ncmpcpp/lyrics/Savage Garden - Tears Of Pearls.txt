And we stare each other down 
Like victims in the grind
Probing all the weakness and 
Hurt still left behind and we cry 
The tears of pearls 
We do it. Oh we do it. 

Is love really the tragedy the way you 
Might describe? 
Or would a thousand lovers 
Still leave you cold inside? 
Make you cry
These tears of pearls 

All these mixed emotions 
We keep locked away like stolen pearls 
Stolen pearl devotions we 
Keep locked away from all the world 

Your kisses are like pearls, 
So different and so rare 
But anger stole the jewels away 
And love has left you bare, 
Made you cry
These tears of pearls 

Well I could be the tired joker 
Pour my heart to get you in 
Sacrifice my happiness just so I could win 
Maybe cry
These tears of pearls 

All these mixed emotions 
We keep locked away like stolen pearls 
Stolen pearl devotions we 
Keep locked away from all the world 

We twist and turn where angels burn 
Like fallen soldiers we will learn 
Once forgotten, twice removed 
Love will be the death
The death of you 

All these mixed emotions 
We keep locked away like stolen pearls 
Stolen pearl devotions we 
Keep locked away from all the world
