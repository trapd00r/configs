Oooh! Ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for. In this corner, weighing 175 pounds, with a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders, the undisputed, most diabolic villain in the world, Slim Shady!

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.
Don’t act like a snobby model .
You just hit the lotto.
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe .
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves
Now where’s the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?
I noticed there’s so many of them and there’s really not that many of us.
Ladies love us and my posse’s kicking up dust.
It’s on till the break of dawn and we’re starting this party from dusk.

Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre…

They see that low rider go by there, like “Oh my!”
You ain’t got to tell me why you’re sick cuz I know why.
I dip through in that six trey like sick ‘em Dre.
I’m an itch that they can’t scratch, they’re sick of me.
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA.
Cuz over and above all, it’s just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends.
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again.
I’ll be dammed, just ****** around and crashed my Benz.
Driving around with a smashed front end.
Let’s cash that one in.
Grab another one from out the stable.
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Derado.
The hell if I know
do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions. Garage looks like precision collision
Or maico beats quake like Waco.
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though.

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.
Don’t act like a snobby model.
You just hit the lotto.
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe .
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves
Now where’s the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?
I noticed there’s so many of them and there’s really not that many of us.
Ladies love us and my posse’s kicking up dust.
It’s on till the break of dawn and we’re starting this party from dusk.

Back when Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk.
Picture us, you’ll just be another one bit the dust .
Just one up my mother’s son who got thrown under the bus.
Kiss my butt. Lick my wonder cheese from under my nuts.
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It’s a must I redeem my name n haters get mushed (?).
Bitches lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut.
Missed the cut. The lady give a (?) some paper cut.
Now picture us. It’s ridiculous you curse at the thought
Cuz when I spit the verse the **** gets worse and worcertshire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It’s elementary. The elephants have entered the room.
I venture to say with the same repetition is true
Not to mention back with a vengeance and hit the signal
Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio is back on you hoes.

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.
Don’t act like a snobby model .
You just hit the lotto.
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe .
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves

It’s on till the break of dawn and we’re starting this party from dusk.

It’s sorta like pourin’ Draino down a live volcano.
You never know what’ll happen next, it may blow.
Same things happen to the beats when Dre blows
I talk ****, but my dick’s long as my payroll
I get *** like a ball player, but I’m a boss player
Pimpin’ hoes from here to Australia.
Till I get heart failure.
Look at ya half of ya’ll, all scared.
Other half, hands up in the air, like “Awww yeah.”
This is our year. This is what you call sheer talent, but I think at this point it’s just obvious
Fierce, they say my music’s good for all queers
Cuz I make your ear ring *****. Ears and all ears (?).
Call us the mafia. We got the ****** mob here.
Gimme the hate and I’ll feed off of ya’s all year.
****, I’m just doing my job here.

You don’t want problem, do ya?
**** it, I’ll even crack a bottle for ya.

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.
Don’t act like a snobby model .
