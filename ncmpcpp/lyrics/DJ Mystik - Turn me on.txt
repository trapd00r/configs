Do you believe in heaven above? 
Do you believe in love? 
Don't tell me a lie 
Don't be false or untrue 
It all comes back to you 

Open fire on my burning heart 
I've never been lucky in love 
My defenses are down 
A kiss or a frown 
I can't survive on my own 

Oooh... 

If a boy walks in 
And carves his name in my heart 
I'll turn and run away 
Everyday we've all been led astray 
It's hard to be lucky in love 

It gets in your eyes 
It's making you cry 
Don't know what to do 
Don't know what to do 
Looking for love 
Calling heaven above 

Send me an angel 
Send me an angel 
Right now right now 

Send me an angel 
Send me an angel 
Right now right now 

Empty dreams can only disappoint 
In a room behind your smile 
But don't give up, don't give up 
You can be lucky in love 

It gets in your eyes 
It's making you cry 
Don't know what to do 
Don't know what to do 
Looking for love 
Calling heaven above 

Send me an angel 
Send me an angel 
Right now right now 

Send me an angel 
Send me an angel 
Right now right now 

Oh baby... 
Oh baby... 
Oh baby...
