I'm gonna take my time
She gon' get hers before I
I'm gonna take it slow
I'm not gonna rush the stroke

So she can get a sensual seduction
So I can get a sensual seduction
So we can get a sensual seduction
Sensual seduction

She might be with him
But she's thinking 'bout me, me, me
We don't go to the mall
We don't go out to eat, eat, eat

All that we ever do
Is play in the sheets, sheets, sheets
Smoke us a cigarette
And go back to sleep, sleep, sleep

'Cuz we done got a sensual seduction
Sensual seduction
Sensual seduction
Sensual seduction

I'm gonna take my time
She gon' get hers before I
I'm gonna take it slow
I'm not gonna rush the stroke

If ya don't know by know
Doggy Dogg is a freak, freak, freak
I keep a bad bitch with me
Seven days out the week, week, week

And all that we ever do
Is play in the sheets, sheets, sheets
Then smoke us a cigarette
Then go back to sleep, sleep, sleep

'Cuz we done got a sensual seduction
Sensual seduction
Sensual seduction
Sensual seduction

I was all in da club, havin' a drink, no one on the suite
When I peeped this little freak out
I was all on the bar when drifter Shawty Redd came over
Then she hit the floor, now

With a see through dress, long hair, light brown eyes
Lookin' like Miss Bo Peep
And a playa know if I take her home, with them real big hips,
She's so right I'm gon' beat

So I approached the chick with the real pretty face
Nice curves although with a little bitty waist
I whispered in her ear, "Lil' mama, what you drink?
I know that you're a freak but you know that I ain't gon' say sh[it]"

See my game is outrageous
I got her to the crib and exchanged some love faces
But it was no need for me to rush to bust one
'Cuz I wanted her to have an eruption

Sensual seduction
Sensual seduction
Sensual seduction
Sensual seduction
Sensual seduction
Sensual seduction
