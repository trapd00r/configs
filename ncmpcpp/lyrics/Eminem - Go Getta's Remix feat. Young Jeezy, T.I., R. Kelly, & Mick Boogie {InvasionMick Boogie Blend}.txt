[Chorus]

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
Hey, hey, this is how we play
When we roll up to the club high sittin on twenty-tre's
Hop out like we fly dealers
Top models grabbin us
They love them Go Getta's only in the mag
Put the D on, chicks like Wallace
Turn 'em forward now, they can have all of this
Can't deny it when you see the wheels spinnin
Boy Kells out the coupe in Miami white linen
Chips big spending, walk up out the club with a shitload of women
Soon as I see what I like I'ma get it
I'ma get it, oh I'ma get it, cause I'ma Go Getta
