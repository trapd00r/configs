Yeah, YEAH
C'mon
Man I just do what the doers do
C'mon, yeah you heard the man
I just do what the doers do

[Verse 1]
Now I been makin hits since underage
Contract intact, can't be under paid
This ain't a game I ain't fun to play
Don't front for me I ain't from the A
Don't you wanna hear what I come to say
This just a kid you know me from before
Prices go up when I come in the store
I'm in another island in a bungalow
Evisu down to my underclose
Ate like a cat that was undersold
I give and get it back in a hundred fo'
I feel like a man that was from the road
And y'all know that I will bring you out
And what I'm talkin you don't know a thing about
Bring Modenas out
Take a scenic route
Bettin against me, it's bound to clean you out

[Chorus]
This is for all of my people
Who stood beside me and still believed
Drop-top cars and SUVs
G5 flights and shopping sprees
This is where you wanna be
This is La Familia

[Verse 2]
It's hard to get low
In a 3-6-0 Spider
License plates all the chicks know
Cats walk aroud buffed up like beach guys
But they don't put no fear in these eyes
Besides, I'm just here to teach lives
Girl walk around, try to give me the slide
The ice on my arm it gave me all away
I roll up the tint top up and rode away
I smell like money, let the odor stay
Go in my closet, fur to throw away
I'm never lost I already know the way
If I need it for tonight I'll get it for today
I'm God-made, I took five years parlay
Home pool, arcade and it's all paid
What say, I spend a third on a upgrade
Import palm trees 'cuz I ain't have enough shade

[Chorus]
This is for all of my people
Who stood beside me and still believed
Drop-top cars and SUVs
G5 flights and shopping sprees
This is where you wanna be
This is La Familia

[Hook]
And when the record plays
What will the haters say
Oh don't you be afraid 'cuz I'm your alliby
So when I'm drivin by
Don't try to analyse
And beacause of him I'ma still be fly
And this our lullaby

[Verse 3]
C'mon now, you know my flow
I'm in and out
Non guilty, I ain't gotta buy the trout
Couple of critics but I ain't gon' stop now
I got a plane to catch to be in Moscow
I'm on jets, they doin sky miles
So I see why the people so hostile
It's no drama, it's mo' honor
I'm wanted in the world like I was Osama
This is no exageration
Why these people so mad at Mason

[Chorus]
This is for all of my people
Who stood beside me and still believed
Drop-top cars and SUVs
G5 flights and shopping sprees
This is where you wanna be
This is La Familia

[Repeat 2X]

Take that, take that
Take that, take that

[Repeat until fade]
