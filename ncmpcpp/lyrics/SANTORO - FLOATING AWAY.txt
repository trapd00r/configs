1) I'm looking for something 
Maybe for the answers for all the changes in my life 
Searching for a feeling 
And im trying to ride out the storms of my life 


Chorus - 
Love and soul, floating away 
Time, be a friend to me...help me through this day 


2) Waking alone and empty 
But some would say I wished it on myself 
Memories and illusions 
This house is now free of your things and your smell 


Chorus - 
Friends with love, floating away 
I really want to be a friend to you...to help you through this day 


Bridge - 
I can feel the sun 
blinding you with reality 
The earth and stars in infinite sky sweeping us away 
I can see it in your eyes 


3) In my dream you were flying 
In a capsule that was hurtling you through space 
I kept trying to stop it 
In the speed of the ship was a shadow of your face 


Chorus - 
Love and soul, doesnt have to float away 
In time we'll be friends you'll see, i'm living day to day
