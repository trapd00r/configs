My lullaby
Hung out to dry
What's up with that
It's over

Where are you dad
Mom's looking sad
What's up with that
It's dark in here

Why, bleeding is breathing
You're hiding underneath the smoke in the room
Try, bleeding is believing
I used to

My mouth is dry
Forgot how to cry
What's up with that
You're hurting me

I'm running fast
Can't hide the past
What's up with that
You're pushing me

Why, bleeding is breathing
You're hiding underneath the smoke in the room
Try, bleeding is believing
I used to
I used to

Why, bleeding is breathing
You're hiding underneath the smoke in the room
Try, bleeding is believing
I saw you crawling on the floor

Why, bleeding is breathing
You're hiding underneath the smoke in the room
Try,  bleeding is believing
I saw you crawling to the door

Why,bleeding is breathing
You're hiding underneath the smoke in the room
Try,bleeding is believing
I saw you falling on the floor
