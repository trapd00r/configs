Wanna know you better
Wanna push you baby
But never too far
Wanna show you heaven
Wanna be like you
Just as strong as you are

I wanna be daylight in your eyes
I wanna be sunlight only warmer
I wanna be daylight in your eyes
I wanna be love only stronger
I wanna be daylight

Wanna live forever
Wanna touch your hand and explode like a star
Wanna stand beside you
Always be together wherever you are

I wanna be daylight in your eyes
I wanna be sunlight only warmer
I wanna be daylight in your eyes
I wanna be love only stronger
I wanna be daylight in your eyes
I wanna be sunlight only warmer
I wanna be daylight

Wanna know you better
Wanna push you baby
But never too far
Wanna live forever
Wanna be like you just as weak as you are
Weak as you are

I wanna be daylight in your eyes
I wanna be sunlight only warmer
I wanna be daylight in your eyes
I wanna be love only stronger
I wanna be daylight in your eyes
I wanna be sunlight only warmer
I wanna be daylight

Daylight
I see it in your eyes
Daylight
I wanna be just you and me
Warmer than sunlight

Daylight in your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes

I wanna be daylight in your eyes
I wanna be sunlight only warmer
I wanna be daylight in your eyes
I wanna be love only stronger
I wanna be daylight in your eyes
I wanna be sunlight only warmer
I wanna be daylight

Daylight
I see it in your eyes
