Am I dreamin' or stupid?
I think I've been hit by Cupid
But no one needs to know right now

I met a tall, dark and handsome man
And I've been busy makin' big plans
But no one needs to know right now

I got my heart set, my feet wet
But he don't even know yet
But no one needs to know right now

I'll tell him someday, someway, somehow
But I'm gonna keep it a secret for now

I want bells to ring, the choir to sing
The white dress, the guests, the cake, the car, the whole darn thing
But no one needs to know right now

I'll tell him someday, someway, somehow
But I'm gonna keep it a secret for now

We'll have a little girl, a little boy
A little Benji we call Leroy
But no one needs to know right now

And I'm not lonely
Anymore at night
And he don't know that only
He can make it right

And I'm not lonely
Anymore at night
And he don't know that only
He can make it right

I'm not dreamin' or stupid
But boy, have I been hit by Cupid
But no one needs to know right now
No one, no one
No one needs to know right now
No one, no one
No one needs to know right now
