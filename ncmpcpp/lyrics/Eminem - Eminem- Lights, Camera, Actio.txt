(feat. Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg)
[Xzibit (Snoop)]
Out of a crowd, picking em out (and what?)
Digging em out to kicking em out (and what?)
Surviving the game is what it's about (and what?)
I'm running this bitch, you running your mouth (then what?)
If I keep dropping heat this hard (what?)
The fucking devil gonna be out of a jar (and what?)
Rakim conversation with God (what?)
I'm so hard with a quad in the prison yard

Magic Johnson need to run for mayor
Lil Kim sold me some pussy, but I aint pay her
You can, hate me now or hate me later
I'm a instigator, (what?) a instigator
It's the, MVPs and SUVs
We don't, take no shit, take yo shit
Leave a, hole in ya face size on Grand Canyon
Head between ya knees, prepare for crash landing
Hand 'em out is not my style
You done, fucked up now but dont look down
We too, high up fo yo bricks to get to
See the skid marks from the shit I've been through
How that sound?, smack me around
Like the national death, nah it's not goin down
Speak ya mind but watch yo mouth
You big sis but no dollars, so that dont count (nigga!)

[Hook 1 - Xzibit (Dr Dre)]
Who wanna get involved with us?
Break down bitches, ball with us
Hit a couple of corners, crawl with us
No matter how you bust, you aint hard as us
It's not, what you say, but how you spit it
It's not, what you got, but how you get it
Come on, Golden State done finally did it
(What made y'all think y'all could fuck wit Xzibit?)

[Hook 2 - Snoop Dogg x2]
Lights, camera, action, show-time
We bust shit back in no time
Yo kind cant fuck with my kind
You must be losin' yo mind

[Xzibit]
Lift off a mark, inhale exhaust
Can never come off soft, I cover the cost
Get lost in the sauce and the city niggas believe me
Pimping aint easy, fat meat be greasy
Hoes cant walk right, pigs never fly straight
What that West like, we rise like the birth rate
First taste of the future, we all hands on
Amputating Satan's last legs to stand on
Head strong re-match, dollar for dollar, bullet for bullet
Niggas dont want it, then dont pull it
Dont shoot it, mind polluted, deeply rooted
Cock back, ready to rock, time to do it

[Xzibit (Snoop)]
Back for more, watch me score (with what?)
With any whore that wanna explore (with what?)
The ups the downs, the ins the outs (then what?)
Kicking that ass, dick in your mouth (so what?)
Piss on ya chest, and put it on tape (now what?)
Have all these bitches calling it rape (and what?)
Slicker than that, so pump your brakes (and what?)
Indite it, fight it, settle the case (w-w-w-w-what?)
