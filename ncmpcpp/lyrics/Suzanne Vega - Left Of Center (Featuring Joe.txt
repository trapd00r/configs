If you want me
You can find me
Left of center, off of the strip
In the outskirts
And in the fringes
In the corner, out of the grip

If you want me
You can find me
Left of center, off of the strip
In the outskirts
And in the fringes
In the corner, out of the grip

When they ask me, "What are you looking at?"
I always answer, "Nothing much" (not much)
I think they know that
I'm looking at them
I think they think I must be out of touch

But I'm only in the outskirts
And in the fringes
On the edge and, off the avenue
And if you want me
You can find me
Left of center, wondering about you

I think that somehow, somewhere inside of us
We must be similar, if not the same
So I continue
To be wanting you
Left of center, against the grain

And if you want me
You can find me
Left of center, off of the strip
In the outskirts
And in the fringes
In the corner, out of the grip

And when they ask me, "What are you looking at?"
I always answer, "Nothing much" (not much)
I think they know that, I'm looking at them
I think they think I must be, out of touch

But I'm only in the outskirts
And in the fringes
On the edge and
Off the avenue
And if you want me
You can find me
Left of center, wondering about you

Wondering about you

If you want me
You can find me
Left of center, wondering about you

If you want me
You can find me
Left of center, wondering about you

Wondering about you
Wondering about you

If you want me
You can find me
Left of center, wondering
If you want me
You can find me
Left of center, wondering about you

Wondering about you
Wondering about you
