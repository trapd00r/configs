[Mos Def]
 Lawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwd, lawd have mercy
 All nice and peace and true, follow me now, we say
 Say Hi-Tek yes you're ruling hip-hop
 Say J. Rawls yes you're ruling hip-hop
 Redefinition say you're ruling hip-hop
 Say Black Star come to rock it non...
 
 Yo, from the first to the last of it, delivery is passionate
 The whole and not the half of it, vocab and not the math of it
 Projectile that them blasted with, accurate assassin shit
 Me and Kweli close like, Bethlehem and Nazareth
 After this you be pressing rewind on top your master disk
 Shining like an asterisk for all those that be gatherin
 Connectin like a roundhouse from the townhouse to the tenaments
 Cause all my Brooklyn residents, ? heavy regiments
 Don't believe, here the evidence, where Brooklyn WHAAAAAAAoohhhh
 See that?  Bound to take it all kid, believe that
 From where they sellin tree at, to where the police be at
 Talib Kweli e-Kweli-ty yo tell them where we be at 
 
 [Talib Kweli]
 Brooklyn New York City where they paint murals of Biggie
 In cash we trust cause it's ghetto fabulous, life look pretty
 what a pity -- blunts is still fifty cents, it's intense
 Tree scents is dominant can't be covered with incense
 My presence felt my name is Kweli from the Eternal Reflection
 People thinkin MC is short hand for Mis Conception
 Let me meditate, set it straight, came to the conclusion
 that most of these cats is featherweight, let me demonstrate
 Walkin the streets is like battlin, be careful with your body
 You must know karate or think your soul is bulletproof like Sade
 Stop actin like a bitch already, be a visionary
 And maybe you can see your name in the column of obituary
 Third rate teacher readin and talkin about,
 "I knew he'd amount to nothin"
 Neighbors like, "He was the quiet type,
 who'd have thought they was frontin?"
 Talkin +Loud+ like you in RCA, get carted away
 with body parts and treys, what a way to start your day
 Yo it's like
 
 Chorus: Mos Def and Talib Kweli
 
 One two three
 Mos Def and Talib Kweli
 We came to rock it on to the tip-top
 Best alliance in hip-hop, wyahhhhh
 I said one two three
 It's kind of dangerous to be a emcee
 They shot Tupac and Biggie
 Too much violence in hip-hop, wyahhhhh
 
 [Mos Def]
 I said Manhattan keep on makin it (Bo!), Brooklyn keep on takin it (Bo!)
 So relax we're takin it back, Redhook where we're livin at
 Plenty cats be strugglin not hustlin and bubblin
 It ain't about production and -- what else we discussin?
 When the cock crows, my crop grows, enable me to rock flows
 Strivin for perfection ever since I was a snot-nosed
 COLOSSAL, true original b-boy apostle
 Standin on the rooftop with the, Zulu gestapo
 
 [Talib Kweli]
 You think you the shit
 somebody in the wings'll force you to quit
 It could be your crew or click
 or some random kid you smoked buddha with
 Consider me the entity within the industry without a history
 of spittin the epitome, of stupidity -- livin my life
 expressin my liberty, it gotta be done properly
 My name is in the middle of e-Kweli-ty
 People follow me and other cats they hear him flow
 And assume I'm the real one with lyrics like I'm Cyrano
 
 [Mos Def]
 Still sippin wishin well water, imported, from Pluto
 Three hundred and sixty milliliters for all our believers
 In miles or kilometers, most cats, cannot proceed us
 in the jungle with the leaders we the lions you the +cheaters+
 A cypher, will complete us if we come through your receivers
 You can play us and repeat us and then take us home and read us
 (line for line) Good Jesus, Mos Def and Kweli just
 make a pussy freeze up, thinkin we will ease up
 
 Chorus
