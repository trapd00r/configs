Gunter glieben glauten globen

(Give it to me, baby) Uh huh, uh huh!
(Give it to me, baby) Uh huh, uh huh!
(Give it to me, baby) Uh huh, uh huh!
And all the girlies say I'm pretty fly for a white guy

Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, cinco, seis

You know it's kind of hard just to get along today
Our subject isn't cool but he fakes it anyway
He may not have a clue and he may not have style
But everything he lacks, well, he makes up in denial

So don't debate, a player straight
You know he really doesn't get it anyway
Gotta play the field and keep it real
For you no way, for you no way
So if you don't rate, just overcompensate
At least you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake
The world needs wannabes
Hey, hey, do that brand new thing

(Give it to me, baby) Uh huh, uh huh!
(Give it to me, baby) Uh huh, uh huh!
(Give it to me, baby) Uh huh, uh huh!
And all the girlies say I'm pretty fly (For a white guy)

He needs some cool tunes, not just any will suffice
But they didn't have Ice Cube so he bought Vanilla Ice
Now cruising in his Pinto, he sees homies as he pass
But if he looks twice, they're gonna kick his lily ass

So don't debate, a player straight
You know he really doesn't get it anyway
Gotta play the field and keep it real
For you no way, for you no way
So if you don't rate, just overcompensate
At least you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake
The world loves wannabes
Hey, hey, do that brand new thing

Now he's getting a tattoo, yeah, he's gettin' ink done
He asked for a 13 but they drew a 31
Friends say he's trying too hard and he's not quite hip
But in his own mind, he's the, he's the dopest trip

(Give it to me, baby) Uh huh, uh huh!
(Give it to me, baby) Uh huh, uh huh!
(Give it to me, baby) Uh huh, uh huh!
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, cinco, seis

So don't debate, a player straight
You know he really doesn't get it anyway
Gotta play the field and keep it real
For you no way, for you no way
So if you don't rate, just overcompensate
At least you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake
The world needs wannabes
The world loves wannabes
Let's get some more wannabes
Hey, hey, do that brand new thing
