Oooh Ma Oooh Pa
Must the show go on
Oooh Pa take me home (take me home, take me home)
Oooh Ma let me go (let me go, let me go)

There must be some mistake
I didn't mean to let them
Take away my soul
Am I too old is it too late

Oooh Ma Oooh Pa
Where has the feeling gone?
Oooh Ma Oooh Pa
Will I remember the songs?

The show must go on
