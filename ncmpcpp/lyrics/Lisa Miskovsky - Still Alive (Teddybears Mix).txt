I have changed
I have changed
Just like you
Just like you

For how long
For how long
Must I wait
I know there's something wrong

Your concrete heart isn't beating
And I've tried to
Make it come alive

No shadows
Just red lights
Now I'm here to rescue you

CHORUS:
Ooooh, I'm still alive
I'm still alive
I cannot apologize, no
Ooooh, I'm still alive
I'm still alive
I cannot apologize, no

So silent
No violence
But inside my head
So loud and clear

You're screaming
You're screaming
Covered up with a smile 
I've learned to fear

Just sunshine
And blue sky
This is all we get
For living here

Come fire
Come fire
Let it burn and love come racing through

CHORUS:
Ooooh I'm still alive
I'm still alive
I cannot apologize, no
Ooooh I'm still alive
I'm still alive
I cannot apologize, no

I've learned to lose
I've learned to win
I turn my face against the ground

I will move fast
I will move slow
Take me where I have to go
