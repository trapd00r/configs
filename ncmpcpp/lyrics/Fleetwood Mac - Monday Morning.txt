Monday morning you sure look fine
Friday I got travelling on my mind
First you love me then you fade away
I can't go on believing this way

I got nothing but love for you
So tell me what you really want to do
First you love me then you get on down the line
But I don't mind, no, I don't mind

I'll be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
I got to get some peace in my mind

Monday morning you sure look fine
Friday I got travelling on my mind
First you love me then you say it's wrong
I can't go on believing for long

But you know it's true
You only want me when I get over you
First you love me, then you get on down the line
But I don't mind, no, I don't mind

I'll be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
I got to get some peace in my mind
