Oh it's healing bang bang bang
I can hear your canons call
You've been aiming at my land
Your hungry hammer's falling
And if you want me, I'm your country

I'm an angel bored like hell
And you're a devil meaning well
You steal my lines and you strike me down
Come raise your flag upon me
And if you want me, I'm your country
If you win me I'm forever, oh yeah

Cause you're the storm that I believe in
And all this peace has been deceiving
I like the sweet life and the silence
But it's the storm that I believe in

Come and conquer, drop your bones
Cross my borders and kill the calm
Bury your things and burn my winds
I hear bullets singing
And if you want me, I'm your country
If you win me I'm forever, oh yeah

Cause you're the storm that I believe in
And all this peace has been deceiving
I need some wind to get me sailing
So it's the storm that I believe in
You feel my heart you keep my breathing
Cause you're the storm that I believe in
