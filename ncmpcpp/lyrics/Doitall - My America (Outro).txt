(with Tyga)


[Chris Brown - Verse 1]
Lil mama what you doin ? wassup?
Cause I aint gotta work this weekend
Lets get up, up, up, up
And I jus wanna dance and play a little bit 
And baby I'm the man and shawty you the shit
Think about it we can do something nasty 
While I got my energy up all in the club 
With the lights down low
And I got you 
Tipsy and youre all up on me pullin all my clothes
I aint finished my drink but I want sum more 
Girl get your purse let me grab my coat 
Got my keys so now we can roll back to the crib

[Chorus]
I wanna make love to my baby
Do it all day and we can do it all night long (shawty)
Im gunna make love to my baby 
Have it you way but I like it with the lights on 
Imma make love to my baby 
Girl get on top of me and imma let you take it off 
Tonight is your night 
Baby So imma love you down 

[Tyga - Verse 2]
All I think about when she not around 
If I get to see her I'm gonna take her down 
Pull your tights down throw em on the couch 
Like ? say put it in your mouth 
Take your top off aint no body round 
Run around butt naked this my house
All these thoughts on my mind I gotta get them out 
Tryin but I cant figure out 
Remember in high school I used to skip class just to sex you 
Homeroom was the only place I could call you 
Now its like every time I call never get thru 
That bullshit that we been through
Dam I miss you 
Its like you kick a nigga out 
Moved on to the next one 
I hope maybe we can work it out 
Dam I be wishin you was here right now 

[Chorus]
I wanna make love to my baby
Do it all day and we can do it all night long (shawty)
Im gunna make love to my baby 
Have it you way but I like it with the lights on 
Imma make love to my baby 
Girl get on top of me and imma let you take it off 
Tonight is your night 
Baby So imma love you down 

[Chirs Brown - Verse 3]
Kissin on your body layin on top me 
From the bed to the ground imma go down 
Doin my thing tell me when to stop 
Girl I wanna see what you all about 
Sweatin like a sauna 
Put that dick on ya all night 
While I got my energy up all the the club 
With the lights down low and I got you 
Tipsy and your all up on me pullin all my clothes 
I aint finished my drink but I want some more 
Girl get your purse lemme grab my coat 
Got my keys so now we can roll back to the crib 

[Chorus]
I wanna make love to my baby
Do it all day and we can do it all night long (shawty)
Im gunna make love to my baby 
Have it you way but I like it with the lights on 
Imma make love to my baby 
Girl get on top of me and imma let you take it off 
Tonight is your night 
Baby So imma love you down
