Yeah

I wanna life without the blues
I wanna go an' see the O's never lose
I wanna house sittin' on the beach
But of all the things that I can't reach

I want you like I never wanted anythin' else before
I want you like I never wanted anythin' else before

Yeah

I wanna know the movie stars
An' be a VIP when I cruise the bars
I wanna spend a ton of cash
I want a fancy car an' I wanna go fast

I want you
I want you
I want you
I want you
I'm gonna get ya

Yeah

I wanna run I wanna fly
I wanna take a trip on a natural high
I wanna go
Where I'm not allowed
I wanna be with you and I will somehow

I want you like I never wanted anythin' else before
I want you like I never wanted anythin' else before

I want you like I never wanted anythin' else before
I want you like I never wanted anythin' else before
