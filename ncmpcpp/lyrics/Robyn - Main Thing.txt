We've got a thing,
We've got a thing,

I know right now it seems like I don't care
I know you think I never did
and it's so hard for me to prove that I'm still here
Because my actions contradict it, but if
Just you let me show you you're wrong 
I know you need time but you will see that if
If you let me show you you're wrong
Nothing can change what you mean to me, 'cause

CHORUS
We've got a thing, you're my main thing
You always were and you'll always be
We've got a thing, you're my main thing
And even when I'm gone you're still close to me

I'm always told that I forget too easily
That I`m too fast on moving on
And because of that this situation really scared me
But I feel my love for you is still strong
Just let me show you you're wrong
Nothing can destroy what you and I built 
I'll keep on holding on
You do your thing and I'll do mine, but still

Chorus (x2)

(Yeah. Babe. Alright. Alright)

Even though I did you wrong
(Let's work it out)
No one knows me like you do
(Let's work it out)
An everyday cliché I know
(Let's work it out)
Even though I'm not, my heart is true,
(Let's work it out)

(Let's work it out) (x2)
Let's work it out
(Let's work it out)
Oh yeah
(Let's work it out)
You know I want to
(Let's work it out)
I wanna work it out
(Let's work it out)
We've got a...
(Let's work it out)
We've got a...
(Let's work it out)

Chorus (x2)
