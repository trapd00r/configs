[Eric Turner]
Oh
Written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the man
Ooooh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I’m on my way

[Tinie Tempah - Verse 1]
Let's go...
Yeah
You’re listening now
They say they ain't heard nothing like this in a while
That's why they play my song on so many different dials

Cause I got more hits than a disciplined child
When they see me everybody brrrrraps, brrrrrraps
Son I’m like a young and fully black Barrack
I cried tear drops over the massive attack

I only make hits like I work with a racket and bat
Look at my jacket and hat
So damn berserk
So down to Earth

I’m bringing gravity back
Adopted by the major I want my family back
People work hard just to get all their salary taxed

Look I'm just a writer from the ghetto like Malorie Blackman
Where the hell's all the sanity at, damn
I used to be the kid that no one cared about
That's why you have to keep screaming until they hear you out

[Chorus]
Oh 
Written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the man
Ooooh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

[Tinie Tempah - Verse 2]
Yeah, I needed a change
When we ate we never tipped cause we needed the change
I needed a break
For a sec I even gave up believing and praying

I even done the legal stuff and was leaded astray
They say money is the root to the evilist ways
But have you ever been so hungry that it keeps you awake?
Mate, now my hunger would leave them amazed

Great, it feels like a long time coming, fam
Since the day I thought of that cunning plan
One day I had a dream I tried to chase it
But I wasn’t going nowhere, running man!

I knew that maybe someday I would understand
Trying to change a tenner to a hundred grand
Everyones a kid that no one cares about
You just have to keep screaming until they hear you out

[Chorus]
Oh 
Written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the man
Ooooh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

[Chorus]
Oh
Written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the man
Ohhhh
The seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way!

[Outro]
