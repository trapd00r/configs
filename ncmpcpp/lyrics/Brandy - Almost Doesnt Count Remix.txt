Look, it's all or nothing baby
Are you in? or are you out? 
If not I gotta let you go

First verse:
Almost made you love me, almost made you cry
Almost made you happy babe, didn't i, didn't i
You almost had me thinkin', you were turned around
But everybody knows, almost doesn't count

Second verse:
Almost hear you sayin', you were finally free
What was always missin'for you babe, you found it in me
But you can't get to heaven, half off the ground
Everybody knows, almost doesn't count

Hook:
I can't keep on lovin' you one foot outside the door
I hear a funny hesitation of a heart thats never really sure
Can't keep on trying if your lookin' for more
Than all that I could give you, than what you came here for

Verse 3:
Gonna find me some other, not afraid to let go
Want a no doubt be there kind of mine
You came real close, but everytime you build me up
You only let me down, but everybody knows, almost doesn't count

Instrumental break - brandy adlibs

Hook:
I can't keep on lovin' you one foot outside the door
I hear a funny hesitation of a heart thats never really sure
Can't keep on trying if your lookin' for more
Than all that I could give you, than what you came here for

Soft bridge:
Maybe you'll be sorry, maybe you'll be cold
Maybe you'll come runnin' back baby, from the cruel, cruel world
Almost convinced me, you're gonna stick around
But everybody knows, almost doesn't count
