8 o'clock get up get outta bed 
I feel like a truck ran over my head 
Another day of stress and sorrow 
Skip breakfast, 'cause I gotta go 
Ain't got no time to take it slow 
And I will do my hair tomorrow 

I can't take it no more 
Oh no no no 
Is this what I'm living for? 

But my Uncle John from Jamaica 
Keeps on calling every day 
Just buy a ticket and take a 
Summer Holi-Holiday 

6 o'clock my job is still not done 
The life I'm living ain't no fun 
Too many days of stress and sorrow 
My boss just won't give me a break 
And this is more than I can take 

Think I will quit this job tomorrow 

But my Uncle John from Jamaica 
Keeps on calling every day 
Just buy a ticket and take a 
Summer Holi-Holiday
