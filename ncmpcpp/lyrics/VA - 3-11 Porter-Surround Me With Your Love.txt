Hello 
Can you hear me 
Please don't go 
Where are you going 
Conversations go over my head 
Isolation has an ugly face 
Surround me with your love 
Understand me I need you now 
Surround me with your words 
Understand me I need your love 
I need your love 
I need your love 

Hello 
I'm so lonely 
And it feels like disease 
Come and stay, stay beside me 
Stay always forever don't go 
Surround me with your love 
Understand me I need you now 
Surround me with your words 
Understand me I need your love
