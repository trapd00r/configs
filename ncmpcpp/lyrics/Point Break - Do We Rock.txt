Do we rock (do we rock)?
Do we rock (do we rock)?
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Do we rock, yeah, yeah?
Take it to the top, yeah, yeah
Don't you stop, yeah, yeah
Woah?

Bring it on down to the next track
Sliding it to you on the lines of the kickback
Coming from a source, the Point Break force
Gonna rock you so good, no choice, no peace
We're the boys from the bright lights, big city
We took no prisoners now we give no pity
Graduated from the school, and went the wrong way
Back on the right track, Point Break's our name

(Bridge)
Come on you all now stand united
Get ready to lose control
Tell us now and you won't regret it
Do we rock and roll?

(Chorus)
Do we rock, yeah, yeah?
Take it to the top, yeah, yeah
Don't you stop, yeah, yeah
Woah?-?-
Do you really wanna rock, yeah, yeah?
Take it to the top, yeah, yeah
Don't you stop, yeah, yeah
Woah?-?-

But now it's rock 'n' roll time like a Friday night
Gonna bang like a Bond with dynamite
Everybody looking cool and looking so fine
'Cos tonight's the night we're gonna have a good time

Volume to sh'nax like it ain't no thing
Get your booty warmed up 'cos it's time to swing
To explode the road when we come your way
To impact, Point Break's to stay

(Bridge)
(Chorus)

We wanna rock with you (come on, come on)
We wanna rock with you (come on, come on, come on)
We wanna rock with you (come on, come on)
We wanna rock with you
Do we rock, do we rock, do we rock, do we rock?

(Chorus)

Do we rock, yeah, yeah (do we rock)?
Take it to the top, yeah, yeah (take it higher)
Don't you stop, yeah, yeah (come on, come on, come on)
We wanna rock with you
Do you really wanna rock, yeah, yeah?
