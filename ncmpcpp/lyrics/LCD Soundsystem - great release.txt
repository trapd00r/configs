And it feels like it won't come on
And it takes like you're full of love

Still the time never to pay on
Still the time never to pay on

It feels like I'm coming home
And it's still like a merry cow
And it feels like it's coming home
And it feels like it's full of love

Still in time is the great release
Something dying will be a great release
