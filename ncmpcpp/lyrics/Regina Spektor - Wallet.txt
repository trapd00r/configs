I found a wallet,
I found a wallet,
Inside were pictures of your small family.
You were so young,
Your hair dark brown,
You had been born in nineteen fifty-three.

Your winter birthday,
Was stamped on the plastic,
Of a license so recently expired.
I was so tired,
As I walked through my door,
I laid all the contents of your wallet on the floor.

And like a holy relic,
Or a mystery novel,
I thumbed them in the dim light,
Searching for a clue.
A blockbuster card,
An old stick of juicy fruit,
A crumpled receipt,
From a pair of leather boots.

I have no wallet,
I have no wallet,
I keep my cards together with a blue rubber band, 
And with a free hand,
I search in my pockets,
For pieces of, pieces of paper and change.

I'll take your wallet,
To my local blockbuster.
They'll find your number,
In their computer.
You'll never know me,
I'll never know you,
But you'll be so happy,
When they call you up.
