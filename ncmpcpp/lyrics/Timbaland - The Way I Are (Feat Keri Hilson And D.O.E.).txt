State of emergency

Timbaland
I ain't got no money
I ain't got no car to take you on a date
I can't even buy you flowers
But together we could be the perfect soulmates
Talk to me, girl

Keri Hilson
Oh, baby, it's alright, now you ain't gotta flaunt for me
If we go dutch, you can still touch my love, it's free
We can work without the perks, just you and me
Thug it out until we get it right

Keri Hilson and Timbaland
Baby, if you strip, you could get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are
(I'm about to strip and I'm well equipped
Can you handle me the way I are?)

I don't need the cheese or the car keys
Boy, I like you just the way you are
Let me see ya strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like, I like, I like

Timbaland
I ain't got no Visa
I ain't got no Red American Express
We can't go nowhere exotic
It don't matter 'cause I'm the one that loves you best
Talk to me, girl

Keri Hilson
Oh, baby, it's alright, now you ain't gotta flaunt for me
If we go dutch, you can still touch my love, it's free
We can work without the perks, just you and me
Thug it out until we get it right

Keri Hilson and Timbaland
Baby, if you strip, you could get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are
(I'm about to strip and I'm well equipped
Can you handle me the way I are?)

I don't need the cheese or the car keys
Boy, I like you just the way you are
Let me see ya strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are

D.O.E.
Baby girl, I don't got a huge ol' house, I rent a room in a house
Listen baby girl, I ain't got a motorboat, but I could float your boat
So listen baby girl, once you get a dose of D.O.E., you gon' want some mo'
So listen baby girl, when I make it, I want you there, want you there, yeah
