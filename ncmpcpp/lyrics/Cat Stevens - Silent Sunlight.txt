Silent sunlight, welcome in
There is work I must now begin
All my dreams have blown away
And the children want to play
They'll soon remember things to do
When the heart is young
And the night is done
And the sky is blue

Morning songbird, sing away
Lend a tune to another day
Bring your wings and choose a roof
Sing a song of love and truth
We'll soon remember if you do
When all things were tall
And our friends were small
And the world was new

Sleepy horses, heave away
Put your backs to the golden hay
Don't ever look behind at the work you've done
For your work has just begun
There'll be the evening in the end
But till that time arrives
You can rest your eyes
And begin again
