Oh I'm on my way, I know I am
Somewhere not so far from here 
All I know is all I feel right now
I feel the power growing in my hair 

Sitting on my own not by myself
Everybody's here with me
I don't need to touch your face to know
And I don't need to use my eyes to see

I keep on wondering if I sleep too long
Will I always wake up the same (or so)? 
And keep on wondering if I sleep too long
Will I even wake up again (or something)

Oh I'm on my way I know I am
But times there were when I thought not
Bleeding half my soul in bad company
I thank the moon I had the strength to stop

I'm not making love to anyone's wishes
Only for that light I see 
'Cause when I'm dead and lowered low in my grave
That's gonna be the only thing that's left of me 

And if I make it to the waterside
Will I even find me a boat (or so)? 
And if I make it to the waterside
I'll be sure to write you note (or something)

Oh I'm on my way, I know I am
Somewhere not so far from here 
All I know is all I feel right now
I feel the power growing in my hair 

Oh life is like a maze of doors
And they all open from the side you're on 
Just keep on pushing hard boy, try as you may 
You're going to wind up where you started from 
You're going to wind up where you started from
