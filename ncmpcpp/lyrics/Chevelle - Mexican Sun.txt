Soon the stares catch
We begin to kill the calm as we
Feed on the facts let's give in
Let's give in to give in more

Still on the knees
Such a shame
The cat's up and run away
Scratched at me first
Then the boy
Gonna panic for a little more
Watch the tail boy
Watch the tail

Like to be feeling the sand
Bring color
Back to both my arms the sun
Let it do damage like they said it
Would if given chance
Had to be shouting your voices
Scheming devils
Never make it through
Hey way to go lad
Can't wait to go

Closing out all my tabs
Tighten down the pitiful
Leave you a pen
Write it down
Or you know what you can do
With that
Watch that tail boy
Watch the tail

Like to be feeling the sand
Bring color
Back to both my arms the sun
Let it do damage like they said it
Would if given chance
Had to be shouting your voices
Scheming devils
Never make it through
Hey way to go lad
Can't wait to go

Let's let the panic bloom
Could help us all end up in the
Clear
Then let the havoc choose
To shape us all, push us to invent
We can feed off shame all day
We could feed of shame all day

Soon the stares catch
We begin to kill the calm as we
Feed on the facts let's give in
Let's give in to give in more

Like to be feeling the sand
Bring color
Back to both my arms the sun
Let it do damage like they said it
Would if given chance
Had to be shouting your voices
Scheming devils
Never make it through
Hey way to go lad
Can't wait to go

Hey way to go lad
Can't wait to go. . .
