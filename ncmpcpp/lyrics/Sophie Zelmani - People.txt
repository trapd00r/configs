I can wake up to a bad day
I know how to go from there
But you
Ican't handle

It's not that you're not welcome
You're amazing in my eyes
It's me that change too much
around you

You are one of those people

I can think of a million reasons
and times when I should
shut my mouth
But I feel like a fool
around you

You are one of those people
that just ain't good for everyone
I have nothing against you people
But I don't like what I become

We will never know eachother
It's not much to cry about
But why I get so strange around you
might be something to work out
