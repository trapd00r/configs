Send "Baby, It's Cold Outside (with Cerys from Catatonia)" Ringtone to your Cell I really can't stay - But baby it's cold outside

I've got to go away - Oh, baby it's cold outside

This evening has been - Been hoping that you'd drop in

So very nice - I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice

My mother will start to worry - Beautiful, what's your hurry

My father will be pacing the floor - Listen to that fireplace roar

So really I'd better scurry - Oh beautiful, please don't hurry

Maybe just a half a drink more - Why don't you put some records on while I pour



The neighbours might think - Oh baby, it's bad out there

Say, what's in this drink - There's no cabs to be had out there

I wish I knew how - Your eyes are like starlight now

To break this spell - I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell

I ought to say no, no, no, sir - Mind if I move a little closer

At least I'm gonna say that I tried - What's the sense of hurting my pride

I really can't stay - Baby don't hold out

Ahh, but it's cold outside



I simply must go - Oh baby, it's cold outside

The answer is no - You know it's cold outside

This welcome has been - I'm lucky that you dropped in

So nice and warm -- Look out the window at that storm

My sister will be suspicious - Oh, your lips are delicious

My brother will be there at the door - Like waves upon a tropical shore

My maiden aunt's mind is vicious - Oh, your lips look delicious

Well maybe just a cigarette more - Never such a blizzard before



I've got to go home - Oh, baby, you'd freeze out there

Say, lend me your comb - You know it's up to your knees out there

You've really been grand - I thrill when you touch my hand

But don't you see - How can you do this thing to me

There's bound to be talk tomorrow - Making my life long sorrow

At least there will be plenty implied - If you caught pneumonia and died

I really can't stay - Get over that old out
