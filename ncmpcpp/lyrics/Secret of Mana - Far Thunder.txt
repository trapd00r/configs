Send "Lighting Strikes" Ringtone to your Cell I close the curtains
Won't let the day light in
Put out the candles
Pour another gin

And when the lightning strikes
The thunder's never far away
And you're the lightning like
I’m thunder on a foggy day
Or so it seems, or so it seems

Darkness approaching
Guess there's a storm breaking in
Rain drops increasing
Stronger gets the wind

Autumn brought shadows
My days of mourning are through
Gone is the sorrow
The way my life has grown

When the lightning strikes
The thunder's never far away
And you're the lightning like
I'm thunder on a foggy day
Or so it seems, or so it seems

Chords on my piano
Fading away in the room
The ticking of a clock or
Is it a metronome

And when the lightning strikes
The thunder's never far away
And you're the lightning like
I'm thunder on a foggy day
Or so it seems, or so it seems
