I've been accused of everything
From Timbuktu to old Berlin
I need some armor for my flesh
I need to stop and take a rest
I've been wide-eyed but couldn't see
I stand accused of being me

I believe in politics
I believe in everything
I believe this world of ours is giving me adrenaline
When I hear a baby cry
When I see an old man die:
That's just the way it is

Rock the shack, rock the shack, rock the shack, rock the shack
Rock the shack, rock the shack, rock the shack, rock the shack
Yeah, that's the way it is

I took each day the way it came
I put my future out of frame
The signs were there for all to see:
Light through our line to you and me

My hand laid on my beating breast
I swear to you I'll pass this test
I'll walk one hundred thousand miles
Ignore the judges 'til my trial
It might try

I believe in politics
I believe in everything
I believe this world of ours is just a den of vice and sin
But even on the darkest night
We could reach for the light
And we could get it right

Get it right, get it right, get it right, get it right
Get it right, get it right, get it right, get it right
We could get it right

I believe in politics
I believe in everything
I believe this world of ours is giving me adrenaline
Ten thousand years ago
Crawling on the floor
Well, get up, Jack
It's time to rock the shack

Rock the shack, rock the shack, rock the shack, rock the shack
Rock the shack, rock the shack, rock the shack, rock the shack
It's time to get up
