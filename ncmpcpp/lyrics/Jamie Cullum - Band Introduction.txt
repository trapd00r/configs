Send "Get Your Way" Ringtone to your Cell Dinner at 8, that sounds fine,
I spose it means you'll turn up round 9,
Bought a bunch of flowers just for her,
She says the burden's on the receiver,

I opened the door and you walked in,
The scent of wild jasmine,
The room seemed to freeze in time,
My regular table will be just fine,

Radiant and elegant you might be, 
But your concentration is so go-lightly,
Both of your eyes reflect the room,
You really think you own the room,

So what game shall we play today?
How about the one where you don't get your way?
And even if you do, that's ok,
So what game shall we play today?
How about the one where you don't get your way?
And even if you do, that's ok,

Try to pick it up, I'm reading the signs,
It's turning out to be a real good time,
Now who'd have thought that entertainment,
Lies in the winter of our discontent,

We sit at the table, face to face,
Queen takes pawn check on, check mate,
I feel your foot brush against my leg,
I'm not that easily led,

You flutter your eyes and touch your hair,
I have to say that it is kinda unfair,
Now let me tell you baby what's in store,
You win the battle but I'll win the war,


So what game shall we play today?
How about the one where you don't get your way?
And even if you do, that's ok,
So what game shall we play today?
How about the one where you don't get your way?
And even if you do, that's ok,

This has been fun, I suppose,
Although my feelings are all juxtaposed,
Truth be told I'm as fickle as hell,
But a gentleman never kisses and tells,

So what game shall we play today?
How about the one where you don't get your way?
And even if you do, that's ok,
So what game shall we play today?
How about the one where you don't get your way?
And even if you do, that's ok.
