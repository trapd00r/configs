Love is blind, as far as the eye can see
Deep and meaningless words to me
Easy lover, I need a friend
Road to nowhere, twist and turns but will this never end
Well my dear you know that he pleases me (Pleases me)
But short-term solution ain't no resolution
There ain't no release for me...

Too much of something is bad enough
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
Too much of nothing is just as tough
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied

Unwrap yourself from around my finger
Hold me too tight or left to linger
Something fine, built to last
Slipped up there, I guess we're running out of time too fast
Yes my dear you know he soothes me (Moves me)
There's no complication, there's no explanation
It's just a groove in me

Too much of something is bad enough (Bad enough)
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
Too much of nothing is just as tough (Just as tough)
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied

What part of no don't you understand (Understand, understand)
I want a man, not a boy who thinks he can...

Boy who thinks he can...
Too much of something is bad enough
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
Too much of nothing is just as tough
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied

Too much of something is bad enough 
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
Too much of nothing is just as tough 
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied

Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try
Too much of something we're probably living a lie
Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try
Too much of something we're probably living a lie
Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try
Too much of something we're probably living a lie
