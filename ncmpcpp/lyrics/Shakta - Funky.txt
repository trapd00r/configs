Well a-hey there baby, do you want to make the scene?
I said a-hey there baby, do you want to make the scene?
Awww well come on over baby, step into my time machine
You best jump into my action, I'm gonna make you feel right
Awww, jump into my action, I'm gonna make you feel right
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow 'cause I'm gonna love you tonight
Step into the front row, I'm gonna show you how
Step into the front row, I wanna show you how
Don't worry 'bout no time we can always come back to right now
Awww and I'm gonna' give it to you
When you wanna come back, we just a turn about
When you wanna come back, we just a turn about
But we ain't gonna' come back 'till there ain't no doubt
Now don't it get good to you, ah-do you know what I mean?
Said don't it get good to you, don't you know what I mean?
Well come on over baby, jump into my time machine
