The sun rises at nine departs at five 
Ain't doing overtime no more 
Because in this world of color 
The brightest picture is plugged right into your wall 
And maybe there's a million people singing shoeshine blues 
To no one that they've ever met before and 
Indifference is a drug that I see people buy 
at the local store, local store 
You, you, you think a little love is all you need 
But love is such a small thing can't you see 
I think you'll find it sits in a book and 
changes the words that you read 

You just feel what you want it to be 
What you want it to feel 
What you want it to be 
Oh 
You just feel what you want it to be 
What you want it to feel 
What you want it to be 

The man in the moon has a cold in the back of his head today 
So dark is the river as the old bridge of lovers 
finds it's getting washed all away 
There are three wise men in the darkness of the desert 
Still trying to be finding their way 
The tables have been laid and the food has been served 
But the cost of eating is too much for most to pay 

You think a little love is all you need 
But love is such a small thing can't you see 
I think you'll find it sits in a book and 
changes the words that you read 

You just feel what you want it to be 
What you want it to feel 
What you want it to be 
Oh 
You just feel what you want it to be 
What you want it to feel 
What you want it to be 

Feel it, feel it 
Go ahead now go 
Well, you just feel what you want it to be 
What you want it to feel 
What you want it to be 
Oh 
You just feel what you want it to be 
What you want it to feel 
What you want it to be 

Feel what you want it to be 
What you want it to feel 

What you want it to be 

(Repeat until the end)
