Rhymes galore(7x)

This is for the motherfuckers out there on some real hiphop shit.
Ya'll, ya'll, ya'll
Mayday mayday, mayday mayday
Walk bare foot on niggas like kuntakinta
So what you say
What is you doin you walkin this way
I burn you like I'm smokin a jalis with helta censa
I be design fashion like Marvin Kanhan
Yes I keep it slamin shit just be bangin just like a loose canon, blow
You better park, niggas are spark, niggas like sharp
niggas a stay up ripen shit a part, niggas float over water like Noa's ark
niggas cover your face and don't get caught up in the scene when nigga dark
Eh, excuse me misses
Sure ta hit you with the fitness
Give you niggas the sickest jumpin johva witness
Beamin in on niggas plotin and skimin
And steady dreamin on how niggas do they double teamin
Fuck the bullshit
My nigga it be best shit on by day before you get secret indidit
Make me slap a nigga lop sided
Hold up son listen
It be so beautiful when we catch you like a nigga so there's to much
pharmasuitable
Come and get it quick
When Busta Rhymes be up in the place
Does who don't like go get the dick I give you a taste
A yo you need just focus on my earth trembalin
Rhymes that ya'll be feel-e-in by the million
Fucka your opin-e-ion
Dominatin like Kings Dominion
Leanin on niggas like we on motorcycles pop a wheel-e and
A yo number one Roman numeral completing the exscutanal shit is usual
I ain't scared of ya
Takin all of ya powafenalia
That's my words on misses Mahelia
Hope you know your best bet
Just to get the fuck out of my area
Before I rip you from myintrea
And hope you know you got to keep a corny nigga smothered grab the gat
off the covet you never know when shit is safe so keep your face covered
While I be scorchin it
A lot of niggas be lookin for alternates
They still just lose their life that's so unfortunate
Trail blazin me since my mother started raisin me
Hit you with the powerful shit that sometimes amazes me
I create junkies just like 12 monkeys
Spreadin right threw out your block
Catchin suspects who thinkin they so lucky
Violen clear for those who cannot properly hear
Frequency so loud shatter a couple a pair of your chandler
Now when I'm in the place give me space
Nothin left for me to do my niggas blew up the place
What the fuck, ha ha
I got rhymes galore
Rhymes galore, ya'll I got rhymes galore, rhymes galore
My Flipmode niggas got rhymes galore, rhymes galore
Busta Rhymes got rhymes galore, rhymes galore
A yo yo I got rhymes galore, yo we got rhymes galore
Rhymes galore, rhymes galore, rhymes galore, rhymes galore
Me and my squad got rhymes galore
