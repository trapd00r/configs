Don't go knock on my door 

Time is up 
No more cheat n' lie 
No more tears to dry 
You and I  we're like so "bye bye" 

Finally 
I am over you 
Totally unblue 
And I can hear myself saying 

I am better off without you 
Stronger than ever and I?I'm tellin' you now 

Don't go knockin' on my door 
Gotta stay away for sure 
You say you miss me like crazy now 
But I ain't buyin' that 

You better get off my back 
Don't go knockin' on my door 

I can see 
It's no mystery 
It's so clear to me 
What we had is all history 

It's OK 
I can sleep at night 
It will be alright 
I can hear myself saying 

I am better off without you 
Stronger than ever and I?I'm tellin' you now 

Don't go knockin' on my door 
Gotta stay away for sure 
You say you miss me like crazy now 
But I ain't buyin' that 
You better get off my back 
Don't go knockin' on my door 

Don't go knock on my door 
Don't go knock on my door 
Don't go knock on my door 
Do what you want 
As long as you don't come back 

Don't go knockin' on my door 
Gotta stay away for sure 
And now I ain't buyin' that 
You better get off my back 

Don't go knockin' on my door 
Gotta stay away for sure 
You say you miss me like crazy now 
But I ain't buyin' that 
You better get off my back 
Don't go knockin' on my door
