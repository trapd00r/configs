(Tony Yayo: "Yeah!
U rockin' with the Talk of New York Tony Yayo
Shady Aftermath and Soul Assassins
Here we go!")

(Chorus: Lloyd Banks)
Niggas Know what I'm about out here 
I don't toot my own horn cause I don't have to 
You can run your mouth I don't care 
but if you get too close I'm gonna clap you 
It's too real out here to be scared 
A real nigga gonna do whatever he has to 
A man is the last thing you should fear 
it ain't considered a crime unless they catch you 
We all die one day 

(Tony Yayo: "Obie Trice")
(Obie Trice) 
Niggas when I step up in the bar, faggots wanna look
like you motherfuckers got Obie Trice shook 
Like I'm gonna stand here as a man and 
let some queer ass funny looking nigga get the upper hand 
I got issues, got no time, got guns that mourn nigga's moms 
shoot up clubs and destroy niggas' vibes 
everybody runnin for their motherfucking lives 
Tough club niggas, we leave early, cock back surely 
open up your fade, your grey brain meets motor city pave 
your nervous system still twitch off Jay Z 
O's an animals skirts get mirked 
don't ever let a nigga tell you slugs don't hurt 
don't ever let a nigga tell you play the bar hard 
trust in God it cause you're about to catch a bullet scar 
I give a fuck where you from who you be with 
keep this a secret right by the nuts 
a 4-5 that'll light niggas up and this 4-5 high make me not give a fuck 

(Chorus) 

(Tony Yayo: "Lloyd Banks")
(Lloyd Banks) 
But as long as I'm here I'm gonna grab checks 
and make my cash stretch longer than giraffe necks 
poverty'll make your ass bet on words 
touch niggas in jail make them wanna finish their last sents' 
they say you live by the gun and die by the next nigga gun 
if that's the case then get a bigga one 
you don't think I pack the pump cause I'm out of the hood 
that's a stereotype like everyone that's black can jump 
I'm in a white mink, the fabric is done 
got rings that bling like Mike, Byrd, Magic and them 
out in Dallas in a palace where the Mavericks is from 
living lavish, I'm established, so the cabbage'll come 
I'm the clouds you won't see me in the trains 
I travel first class you don't even got a TV on your plane 
You should be easy on my name, cause I don't going back and forth 
your boss and your captain's soft 

(Chorus) 

(Tony Yayo: "Yo Em spin that shit")
(Eminem)
We gonna bring it to anybody who want it 
you want it? you gonna get it 
name 'em, we gon' hit em, chew em up and spit em out 
too much venom and if you roll with 'em 
we gonna fuck you up with 'em 
I got too much momentum movin in my direction to lose 
my shoes will explode as soon as you go to step in 'em (BROOM) 
you know how we do it when we do how we do it when we come through 
G-Unit, D-1-2 and Obie we all move like assassins 
ski mask and gloves consider this as a warning 
disaster comes faster than you can react to it, just ask Muggs 
but we are fizzast, fuck your little bitch ass up 
we are not killers, my vato will have you shot though 
drag through the barrio and fucked like Kim Osario 
little sorry hoe ass, go ask B Real 
we burn source covers like fuckin Cypress Hill 
did in the 90s, when you was in diapers still 
shady records you better believe the hype is real 
this is no joke, I don't smoke 
but I toke enough second hand to make my fuckin P.O. choke 
I'm an OG, you're fuckin with a GI Joe 
Bia Bia, mia meo a vida loco 
I'm a psycho, Mariah ain't got shit on me 
when I retire I'll be spittin baby food on people 
at San Pedro ranch, huddled up next to her 
with Hello Kitty slippers on, humping her legs 
you ever had your cat peeled back or your shit pushed in 
I put my blade in your like a fucking pin cushion 
slice your ear clear off, Smirnoff and Henn dog
I'll show you how to kill a fucking man like Sen Dog 
Nobody told you that I'm loco S.A.? 
I lack every sane chemical in my membrane 
I'm slim sha-"D" and the "d" is for deez nuts 
and you can get each one for free so feast up 
I pee in a cup for three months, I'm having an E party for Easter please come 

(Tony Yayo: Here We Go)
(50 Cent)
We gonna bring it to anybody who want it 
you want it? you gonna get it 
name em, we gon hit em, chew em up and spit em out 
too much venom and if you role with 'em 
we gonna fuck you up with 'em 
you can do all them push ups to pump up your chest 
I got a 12 gauge Mossburg to pump up your chest 
have you gasping for breath after that shell hit your vest 
fear me like you fear god cause I bring death 
Silverback gorrilla in the concrete jungle 
I'm the strongest one around you know how I get down 
I watch gangsta flicks and root for the bad guy 
and turn it off before it ends cause the bad guy die 
if you trying to buy guns I'm the nigga to look to 
so what they got bodies on 'em, they still look new 
you can raise your voice like you fin to touch something 
when I raise my knife shit I'm fin to cut something 
see I walk like Ron O'Neil and talk like Goldie 
if the bitch think I love her the bitch don't know me 

(haha Sorry Kim haha..Oh sorry haha) 

(Chorus)
