If You Can Feel What I'm Feeling Then It's A Musical Masterpiece
But If You Can Hear What I'm Dealing With Then That's Cool At Least
What's Running Through My Mind Comes Through In My Walk 
True Feelings Are Shown From The Way That I Talk

And This Is Me, Y'All - I M.C., Y'All 
My Name Is M.C.A. And I Still Do What I Please 
And Now I'd Like To Introduce (What's up?)
I'll Pass The Mic To D. For A Fist Full Of Truth

The Name Is D., Y'All And I Don't Play 
And I Can Rock A Block Party 'Til Your Hair Turns Grey 
"So, What You Sayin'?" I Explode On Site
And Like Jimmy Walker I'm "Dynomite" 
And Now I'd Like To Pass The Mic 
To Adrock C'mon And Do Anything You Like

I'm The A.D.R.O.C.K. 
In The Place With The Bass I'm Going All The Way 
I Can't Stop Y'All Tock Tick Y'All 
And If You Think That You're Slick You'll Catch A Brick Y'All 
'Cause I'm A Turn It In And I'm A Turn It Out 
But Now I Got To Pass The Mic To Yauch

Well On And On And On And On 
I Can't Stop Y'All 'Til The Early Morn'
So Rock Rock Y'All Tick Tock Y'All 
To The Beat Y'All C'mon And Rock Y'All

I Give Thanks For Inspiration 
It Guides My Mind Along The Way
A Lot Of People Get Jealous, They're Talking About Me
But That's Just 'Cause they haven't got a thing to say

Well, Everybody's Rapping Like It's A Commercial 
Actin' Like Life Is A Big Commercial 
So This Is What I've Got To Say To You All 
Be True To Yourself And You Will Never Fall 
And Now I'd Like To Pass The Mic To The A 
So What's Your Name, Yauch? My Name Is M.C.A. 

I've Been Coming To Where I Am From The get go
Find That I Can Groove With The Beat When I Let Go 
So Put Your Worries On Hold 
Get Up And Groove With The Rhythm In Your Soul 
And Now I'd Like To Pass The Mic 
To My Brother Adrock C'mon And Shine Like A Light

Yes Yes Y'All And Yes Yes Y'All 
I'm Always On Time Never The Less Y'All 
And That's Right Y'All, I Shed Light Y'All 
I've Got No Time In My Life To Get Uptight Y'All 

So What You Gonna Say That I Don't Know Already? 
I'm Like Clyde And I'm Rockin' Steady 
But Time Flies When You're Having Fun 
So Mike D - That's Me - C'mon And Get Some

M.I.K.E. To The D. 
You Come And See Me And You Pay A Fee 
Do What I Do Professionally 
To Tell The Truth I Am Exactly What I Want To Be
Now Ad-Rock And M.C.A. 
Let's Rock This Joint In The Old School Way

Well I'm On till The Crack Of Dawn 
Mowing Down M.C.'s Like I'm Mowing A Lawn 
I Go Off Like Nothing Can Phase Me
You Think We'll Ever Meet Stevie? One Of These Days, D.

But I Can Stand My Ground And I Am Down 
To Wax An M.C. Who Acts Like A Clown 
But For Now, I'd Like To Ask You  How 
You Like The Feel Of The Bass In Your Face In The Crowd
