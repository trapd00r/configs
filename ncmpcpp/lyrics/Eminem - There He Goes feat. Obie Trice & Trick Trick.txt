Yeah
Ay, Em, you ready?
Herc, you got them thangs nigga? (you know)
Detroit city!

[Chorus: Obie Trice]
There they go, them D-town boys carry the Calico
Whenever there's war, you gotsta know
Them boys got toys tear down the front door
Detroit make noise everywhere that we go
There they go, there they go

[1st verse: Obie Trice]
You are not convincing
When Detroit blocks stay flocked with henchmen
Niggaz get popped for instance, infrared dot for distance
Get knocked by the cops, cop on some pen shit
Straight detention, a nigga doing tension
Once released he on that music buisness
When viewing 106 and them cafeterias
Only to find that rap's actually serious
Deliriously resort back to crack and vigilence
Same shit that sent em upper Michigan
Us is pimping, a difference, from any city I visited
It's that Detroit spirit and if we in it, balling out till the ending, period
Use O as a reference to that sentence
The message I'm sending you, best just pay attention

[Chorus]

[2nd Verse: Big Herc]
If you don't like how I act then blow me
I don't really give a shit, I represent the real cats who know me
Man what's up with that scratch you owe me?
Now run my chips before we fall out like Shaq and Kobe
Big Herc on a track with Obie, when you come to the D
It's cut-throat, better be packing homie
And niggaz get they shit split for acting phonie
We're known for the glocks and the choppas
These niggaz'll rob you, leave you standing in ya socks and ya boxers
We got real G's and lots of imposters
I smoke the real trees, see I cop from the rastas
Ya'll niggaz ain't impress me yet
Ya'll yapping, not rapping, turn that shit off and press eject
See we known for the car shows, running from the narcos
Keep them bottles coming, we gon pop em till the bar close

[Chorus]

[3rd Verse: Eminem]
Meat cleaver, leave a gas in a bitches ass
See her dreams of being an R&B singer diva
Leave her face, cut her from the waist
Ah man what a waste, of a pretty face
And this place ain't just safe, it's just straight gangsta
It ain't just New York or L.A. that pains no more
There's Latin Coun' Kings here
Southside, four, East Side and Gansen
Nuthin but ganglands and, spray paint cans
And when that van rolls up, man they ain't glancing
That window rolls down and that tre-eight's dancing
And them shooters don't miss, homie they hate chancing
Straight for the dome and it's vacate fast and
Get the fuck outta dodge 'fore that blue Dodge flashing
Red and blue lights, no ambulance, you got flattened
And this was not supposed to be no Detroit anthem
But just so ya know, if ya see them D-Boys passing

[Chorus]

[Outro: Trick Trick]
Here we go motherfuckers
This the motherfuckin back acha Trick
Don't even dream of fucking up in Detroit, bitch
This is where the real killers at
Detroit motherfucker!
Ain't never no difficulty smashing no bitch ass niggaz
Matter of fact, bring your bitch ass to Detroit nigga
We got something for your ass
[Gun shots fade out]
[Laughter]
