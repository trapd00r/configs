Do I have to change my name? Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight? Am I gonna be a star?

I tried to be a boy, I tried to be a girl
I tried to be a mess, I tried to be the best
I guess I did it wrong, that's why I wrote this song
This type of modern life - Is it for me?
This type of modern life - Is it for free?

So I went in to a bar, looking for sympathy
A little company - I tried to find a friend
It's more easily said, it's always been the same
This type of modern life is not for me
This type of modern life is not for free

American life (American life)
I live the American dream (American dream)
You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream (American life)

I tried to stay ahead, I tried to stay on top
I tried to play the part, but somehow I forgot
Just what I did it for and why I wanted more
This type of modern life - Is it for me?
This type of modern life - Is it for free?

Do I have to change my name? Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight? Am I gonna be a star?

American life (American life)
I live the American dream (American dream)
You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream (American life)
(American life)

I tried to be a boy,  tried to be a girl
Tried to be a mess, tried to be the best
Tried to find a friend, tried to stay ahead
I tried to stay on top...

Fuck it!
Do I have to change my name? Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight? Am I gonna be a star?
Oh, fuck it! (x4)

I'm drinking a soy latte,
I get a double shotte, it goes all through my body,
And you know I'm satisfied
I drive my Mini Cooper
And I'm feeling super-dooper
Yo they tell me I'm a trooper
And you know I'm satisfied
I do yoga and pilates
And the room is full of hotties
So I'm checking out the bodies
And you know I'm satisfied
I'm digging on the isotopes
This metaphysics shit is dope
And if all this can give me hope
You know I'm satisfied
I got a lawyer and a manager
An agent and a chef
Three nannies, an assistant
And a driver and a jet
A trainer and a butler
And a bodyguard or five
A gardener and a stylist
Do you think I'm satisfied?
I'd like to express my extreme point of view
I'm not a Christian and I'm not a Jew
I'm just living out the American dream
And I just realised that nothing
Is what it seems

Do I have to change my name?
Am I gonna be a star?
Do I have to change my name?
Am I gonna be a star?
Do i have to change my name?
