Behind the sun - I found some one - my china woman, oh no
She's painting clouds - day in day out - my china girl, don't go
Oh I can't oh I can't, oh I can't ignore
The way she looks to me
Oh I can't - oh I can't - oh I can't give her more
Just my heart, she is my destiny

She has:China in her eyes - can't you see it
China in her eyes - can't you feel it
China in her eyes - a secret smile
Oh can't you see, it's you and me - my china woman, oh no
I miss you so, can't let you go - my china girl - don't go

Behind brown eyes, she's mystify - my china woman, oh no
It's like a dream the moon turns green - my china girl, don't go
I believe, I believe, I believe, I'll fly
I'm writing hearts to you
And I wait and I wait, see a rose in the sky
Take my heart, what have I got to do
