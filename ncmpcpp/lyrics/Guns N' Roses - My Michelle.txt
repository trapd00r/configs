Your daddy works in porno
Now that mommy's not around
She used to love her heroin
But now she's underground

So you stay out late at night 
And you do your coke for free 
Drivin' your friends crazy 
With your life's insanity 

Well, well, well, you just can't tell
Well, well, well, my Michelle
Look out

Sowin' all your wild oats
In another's luxuries
Yesterday was Tuesday
Maybe Thursday you can sleep

But school starts much too early 
And this hotel wasn't free 
So party till your connection calls 
Honey, I'll return the key

Well, well, well, you just can't tell 
Well, well, well, my Michelle 
Well, well, well, you never can tell 
Well, well, well, my Michelle 

Everyone needs love 
You know that it's true 
Someday you'll find someone 
That'll fall in love with you

But oh the time it takes
When you're all alone 
Someday you'll find someone
That you can call your own 
But till then you better

Now you're clean and so discreet
I won't say a word 
But most of all this song is true
Case you haven't heard

So c'mon and stop your cryin'
We both now money burns
Honey don't stop tryin'
And you'll get what you deserve

Well, well, well, you just can't tell 
Well, well, well, my Michelle 
Well, well, well, you never can tell 
Well, well, well, my Michelle

My, my, my Michelle
My, my, my Michelle
Ooh, my, my, my Michelle
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my Michelle
Michelle
