Eminem
If there's any bitches in this room, then there's something I gotta say 
For all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way 
I've been down that road and now I'm back, sittin' on square one 
Tryna pick myself up where I started from 

Obie Trice 
I never woulda thought that I'd see you outta control 
Even though my penis was deep down in your hole 
You should know between us we was like mates to soul 
Nothing could intervene us, especially no hoes 
You was more or so the chalant type, I chose 
To more shows, haunted you nights I suppose 
That's how it go, with time spent, emotion grows 
In the beginning, friends we decided to roll 
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode 
And Obie's grinning, then you invite that Obie's cold 
But bitches the gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate 
We established this way before we became mates 
So whats required is that you chill with all that fire 
Get your desire when I retire 

Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine 
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine 
Lord knows I was right cuz you just crossed the line 
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine 

Eminem
I used to say I never met a girl like you before 
Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are 
Almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters 
Till you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers 
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for 
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore 
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours 
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls 
If you recall I used to treat you like a groupie broad 
When we fucked I refused to even take my jewelry off 
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off 
It was a shock, it struck me as odd but it turned me on 
You started getting moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue 
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me 
And who woulda even knew that who woulda even thought possibly 
Cupid could shoot another one of them God damn darts at me 
It's true that I got shot in the heart 
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are 
But see, when you're in it it's too hard to see 
Till you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach 
Up under the seat as your heart starts to beat 
Before you make a decision that's life altering 
And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave 
You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring 

Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine 
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine 
Lord knows I was right cuz you just crossed the line 
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

Stat Quo 
In most cases, Stat's attitude is fuck-a-bitch 
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch 
But you was different, thought we shared a covenant 
Even held your hand in public, we sufferin' because of this 
Shorty on some whole 'notha other shit 
Tryna play sick thinkin' i'mma trick off rick 
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit 
Feed you the best of me, I shoulda fed you piss 
We started off closer than close 
But who coulda predicted to know, your triflin' ways woulda stopped our growth 
And the final result, back in that same boat 
I ask myself, do I love these hoes? NO! 

50 Cent
Em introduced us, "50 this is Tanya, Tanya this is 50" 
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me 
I complimented her, I said you have very nice lips 
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick 
We played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast 
Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass 
Downtown Manhattan on the balcony, stare at the skyline 
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind 
She got to talkin', talkin' like an opportunist too 
Why talk when suckin' my dick is the real career move? 
Said she's an inspiring actress, she do videos for practice 
Yeah, yeah, now how many times have I heard that shit? 

Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine 
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine 
Lord knows I was right cuz you just crossed the line 
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
