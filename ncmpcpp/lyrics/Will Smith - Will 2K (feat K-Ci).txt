Here it comes the party of a lifetime
31st of December
Man I remember when the ball dropped for 90
Now it's 9-9, ten years behind me
What's gonna happen?
Don't nobody know
We'll see when the clock gets to 12-0-0
Chaos, the cops gonna block the street
Man who the hell cares?
Just don't stop the beat
No time to sleep, yo it's on tonight
K-C you feeling me right? (Ooh Yeah)
2-0-0-0, the Will 2 K
The new millennium, yo excuse me Willennium (yeah)
It can't get thicker than this (Big Will)
Slick like Rick I can't miss
(And we gonna party like it's 19)
Hold up it is

(K-Ci)
Here it comes another year
Come on everyone, new millennium
Here it comes another year
Everyone, new millennium

(Will Smith)
There's a party tonight
Everybody was drinking
The house was screaming
And the bass was shaking
And it won't be long
Till everybody knowing
That twelve o'clock the roof will be blowing
Drinks on me, up the cups, and
Midnight coming full thrust, and
Dick Clark holding it down, and
The second hand rolling around (Na, na, na, na)
Hundred thousands deep, world wide press
Hate to be the man that gotta clean this mess
Same resolution, get the money
Ain't where we've been, it's where we gonna be
Get ready to hum Auld Lang Syne
Cause a person that know the words is hard to find
First soul train line of the year
Four, three, two, one

(K-Ci) (Will Smith)
Its here and I like it
(Whoo! K-Ci y'all, K-Ci y'all)
Gonna pack the dance floor
(And do what with it?)
Rock the dance floor
(Uh, uh, uh)

(K-Ci)
Here it comes another year
Come on everyone, new millennium
Here it comes another year
Everyone, new millennium

(K-Ci)
Say yeah, yeah
(Come on)
Say yeah, yeah
(I can't hear y'all)
Say yeah, yeah
(What? What? What?)
Say yeah, yeah
(Come on, come on)
Say yeah, yeah
(I can't hear y'all)
Say yeah, yeah
(I can't hear y'all)
Say yeah, yeah
(Ha-ha-ha)
Yeah, yeah

(Will Smith)
I remember trying to count how old I'd be
When the clock struck twelve in the year two g
Medianoche finally near
This will be that anthem amongst the cheers
Just the man to usher it in
Big Will bringing the heat
K-Ci bringing the plan
Ringing it in, waiting for the ball to drop
That 2000 vault we breaking the lock
Let hip-hop keep blazing the charts
May the past keep a warm spot in your heart
May the future hold more joy then pain
Hands in the air waiting for confetti to rain

(K-Ci)
Its here and I like it
Gonna pack the dance floor
Rock the dance floor

(K-Ci)
Here it comes another year
Come on everyone, new millennium
Here it comes another year
Everyone, new millennium

(Will)
There's a party tonight
Everybody was drinking
The house was screaming
And the bass was shaking
And it won't be long
Till everybody knowing at twelve o'clock
At 12 o'clock
Say what? Say what? Say what? What?

(K-Ci)
Here it comes another year
Come on everyone, new millennium
Here it comes another year
Everyone, new millennium

(Will)
True dat, true dat, true dat
Yo London, uh come on
Yo Bangkok, come on, come on
LA, ha, ha
The NYC
Come on, say what? Say what?
Yo Philly, come on, hey
Hey Tokyo, come on
Everybody say what now
Say what now, saw what now
Come on, come on, come on
