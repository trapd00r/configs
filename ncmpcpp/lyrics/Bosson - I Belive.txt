You say of love

There's no such thing

You've only known

The pain it brings



You question why

I give your heart

You stay alone

You stay apart



I've seen

I know

I trust

I feel

Love is alive and for real



And I believe

I believe in love

I believe two hearts

Can learn to beat as one



And I believe

I believe that time

Can tie your soul to mine

I see the doubt there in your eyes

But I believe (in love)



I know you're scared

I understand

Please take my word

And take my hand



If there's no faith

Inside of you

I can believe

Enough for two



I've seen

I know

I feel

I trust

Love has a future for us



[CHORUS]



I believe I believe in love

Two hearts can beat as one

I believe I believe that time

Can tie your soul to mine
