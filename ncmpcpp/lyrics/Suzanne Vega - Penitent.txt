Once I stood alone so proud
Held myself above the crowd
And now I'm low on the ground

From here I look around to see
What avenues belong to me
I can't tell what I've found

Now what would you have me do?
I ask you please
I wait to hear

The mother and the matador
The mystic, each were here before
Like me to stare you down

You appear without a face
Disappear but leave your trace
I feel your unseen frown

Now what would you have me do?
I ask you please
I wait to hear
Your voice
The word
You say
I wait
To see your sign
Would I
Obey?

I look for you in heathered moor
The desert and the ocean floor
How low does one heart go?

Looking for your fingerprints
I find them in coincidence
And make my faith to grow

Forgive me all my blindnesses
My weakness and unkindnesses
As yet unbending still

Struggling so hard to see
My fist against eternity
And will you break my will?

Now what would you have me do?
I ask you please
I wait to hear
Your voice
The word
You say
I wait
To see your sign
Would I
Obey?

Now what would you have me do?
I ask you, please.
I wait to hear
Your voice
The word
You say
I wait
To see your sign
Could I
Obey?
