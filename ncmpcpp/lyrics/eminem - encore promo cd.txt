Yo yo yo yo yo (this is)
This is my motherfucking anthem (hip hop)
To hip hop music (anthem)
Cause I'm gonna keep doing hip hop music
until the day that I die (aight bitch)

Yo I'm into voodoo, tarot cards and ugji boards
Lighting candles camping out at haunted beach resorts
I write the dark shit, and rap about perverted violence
Ghost stories of people murdered on deserted islands
Dressed in jean shorts, high tops and tube socks
Holding a rifle, with a life full of drama like Tupac's
Jumping off roof tops drunk after i do shots
Landing in someone's backyard getting chewed up by two rotts
I got a new watch and two rings with huge rocks
This rap shit got cash coming out the blue like nude cops
I use to sell pizza's, now i got twelve visa's
So tell jesus I'm gonna quit sending when hell freezes

That's why my brain is out of order
That's probley why my nights are getting colder and my day seems shorter
But as the world turns and I keep growing older
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
Bitch till hell freezes over
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
And as the world turns and i keep growing older
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes...over

Yo I use to be to heavy in that cruising rap shit crap
I think i fucked my head up listing to acid rap
I go to party's bumping nasty nas's new song
And smoke pot till I get high and I stare at shit for too long
Like this weed is laced ain't, it taste tainted
Your whole place fainted, I woke up with my face painted
Spaced out like sci-fi t.v.
Fuck ICP buy my cd
cause while I'm screaming while I'm handing out promo tapes of my debut
telling bitches let me eat your pussy while I shave you
Ain't no shame in my game I turn the party out
Making everybody shout for the rapper with potty mouth

That's why my brain is out of order
That's probley why my nights are getting colder and my day seems shorter
But as the world turns and i keep growing older
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
Bitch till hell freezes over
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
And as the world turns and i keep growing older
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes...over
