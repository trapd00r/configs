I didn't hear you leave
I wonder how am I still here 
I don't want to move a thing 
It might change my memory 

Oh I am what I am, I'll do what I want
But I can't hide 

I won't go, I won't sleep, I can't breathe
Until you're resting here with me 
I won't leave, I can't hide, I cannot be
Until you're resting here with me 

I don't want to call my friends
They might wake me from this dream 
And I can't leave this bed
Risk forgetting all that's been 

Oh I am what I am, I'll do what I want
But I can't hide 

I won't go, I won't sleep, I can't breathe
Until you're resting here with me 
I won't leave, I can't hide, I cannot be
Until you're resting here with me 

I won't go, I won't sleep, I can't breathe
Until you're resting here with me 
I won't leave, I can't hide, I cannot be
Until you're resting here with me 

Oh I am what I am, I'll do what I want
But I can't hide 

I won't go, I won't sleep, I can't breathe
Until you're resting here with me 
I won't leave, I can't hide, I cannot be
Until you're resting here with me 

I won't leave, I can't hide, I cannot be
Until you're resting here with me

I won't go, I won't sleep, I can't breathe
Until you're resting here with me 
I won't leave, I can't hide, I cannot be
Until you're resting here with me
