Baby, baby, we like your lips
Baby, baby, we like your pants
All aboard for funtime

Baby, baby, we want in
We want some we want some
All aboard for funtime

Last night I was down in the lab
Talking to Dracula and his crew
All aboard for funtime

Oh I feel lucky tonight
Want to get some and run around
All aboard for funtime

Baby, baby, we like your lips
Baby, baby, we like your pants
All aboard for funtime

Everybody we want in
We want some we want some
All aboard for funtime
