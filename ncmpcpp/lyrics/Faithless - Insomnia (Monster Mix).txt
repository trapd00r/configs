Deep in the bosom of the gentle night
Is when I search for the light
Pick up my pen and start to write
I struggle, fight dark forces in the clear moon light
Without fear, insomnia, I can't get no sleep

I used to worry, thought I was goin' mad in a hurry
Gettin' stress, makin' excess mess in darkness
No electricity, something's all over me, greasy
Insomnia, please, release me and let me dream of
Makin' mad love to my girl on the heath

Tearin' off tights with my teeth
But there's no release, no peace
I toss and turn without cease
Like a curse, open my eyes and rise like yeast

At least a couple of weeks
Since I last slept, kept takin' sleepers
But now I keep myself pepped
Deeper still, that night I write by candle light
I find insight, fundamental movement, uh

So when it's black, this insomniac, take an original tack
Keep the beast in my nature under ceaseless attack
I gets no sleep, I can't get no sleep

I can't get no sleep, I can't get no sleep
I need to sleep, I can't get no sleep
I need to sleep, I can't get no sleep
