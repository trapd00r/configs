Send "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman" Ringtone to your Cell I used to think
I had the answers to everything
But now I know
That life doesn't always
Go my way, yeah
Feels like I'm caught in the middle
That's when I realize

[Chorus]
I'm not a girl
Not yet a woman
All I need is time
A moment that is mine
While I'm in between

I'm not a girl
There is no need to protect me
It's time that I
Learn to face up to this on my own
I've seen so much more than you know now
So don't tell me to shut my eyes

[Chorus]

I'm not a girl
But if u look at me closely
You will see it in my eyes
This girl will always find
Her way

(I'm not a girl)
I'm not a girl don't tell me what to believe
(Not yet a woman)
I'm just tryin' to find the woman in me, yeah
(All I need is time) all I need
(A moment that is mine) that's mine
While I'm in between

I'm not a girl
Not yet a woman
All I need is time (is all I need)
A moment that is mine
While I'm in between

I'm not a girl
Not yet a woman.
