When tears are in your eyes 
It's time to look inside 
Your heart can find another way 

Believe in what I say 
Don't throw this time away 
Tomorrow will be Christmas Day 

[chanting]

Christmas Day... 

So let the shadows go 
And drift away like snow 
Tomorrow will be Christmas Day 
Tomorrow will be Christmas Day 

[chanting]

Christmas Day... 

So dream until the night, 
Becomes the morning light 
Tomorrow will be Christmas Day 
Tomorrow will be Christmas Day
