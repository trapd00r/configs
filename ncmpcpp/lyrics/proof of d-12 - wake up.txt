I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills

Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of valium inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
To roll up on you like Christopher Reeve
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by 6 people
And 5 I hit
Ah shit
I started a mosh pit
Squashed a bitch
And stomped the foster kids
These shrooms make me hallucinate
Then I sweat till I start losing weight
Till I see dumb shit start happenin'
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin to rap again
So bounce, bounce, c'mon bounce
I said c'mon bounce
Everybody in the house bought a half an ounce
Not weed I meant coke dumb ass sit down
We don't bullshit, better ask around
D12 throws the bombest bash in town
Bizarre, your mom is passing out
Get her ass on the couch 'fore she crashes out

Fuck that, someone help Denaun
He's upstairs naked with a weapon drawn
Hey Ma
You see me stepping on these leprechauns?
It gotta be acid cuz the X is gone
Ya I took them all dog with some parmesian
And I think my arm is gone
It's probably numb young, dumb, and full of cum
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue
Scary ass it was a false alarm
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on
Well stop acting stupid
You so high
That you might wake up with a guy
On some new shit
I think I did too much
This substance equals cuffs
Red pills, blue pills, and green
Big pills (That's ill)
Mescaline

I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills

Dirty Dozen
80 of us
Shady brothers
Ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers
Love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other out
And date each other
Some-, something, something, something
Something, something, something, something

Pop pills
Pills I pop
Pop two pills
On stilts I walk
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought it was Incredible I killed the Hulk
I wanna roll away
Like a rollerblade
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when I'm old and gray
Look for coke to smoke
I overdose
When I pack up my nose with coke
(cough cough cough)
I musta blowed the choke?
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Ahh, poor baby
Born by whore lady
Now I gotta straight born infant
(You're crazy!)
I pop four E's at one time
And I don't need water when I'm swallowing mine
(You got any shroom?)
Does Bizarre smoke crack?
I can't get jobs
cuz our arms show track
Why the hell you niggas think I rap?
I do it just to get your company hijacked
If you like smack
Then I might too
(Swift, chill)
I just wanna get high like you
And I don't give a damn if they white or blue
Speed, shrooms, down the valiums
Even smoke weed outta vacuums
I just got some and I'm going back soon

I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
I been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills

I'm at rave
Looking like a slave
High off chronic
Gin and tonic demonic
Body smellt like vomit
Pussy poppin', acid droppin', dope headed guy
Heroine mescaline, pencil leads, Wanna try?
Blue pills, golden seals
Got Bizarre actin' ill
Drugs kill (Yeah, right)
Bitch I'm for real
Shut your mouth you dirty slut
You know you want it in your butt
I'll put it in your cunt Let Bizarre nutt

I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
I been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
