[Verse 1: Method Man] 
Oh no, another flow lyrica forty fo' 
If it gets deep, jump in feet first then hold yo' nose 
I'm a beast when you step on my toe you hear my whistle 
Checkin 'em hoe, you see my pistol lettin it go 
I couldn't wait to do a song right, hardly 'gon do ya wrong 
Time to party, Meth, Stephen Marley and Jr. Gong 
So selecta, come with it, awww shit it 
Now y'all done did it, supper ready y'all come get it 
Now who 'gon stop me block me pop lock me knock me 
Jamaica posse most high Haile Selassie 
Allah willin, another sound boy killin 
I'm hot bitch I don't catch cold or catch feelings 
The truth be the ghetto youth 
And Def Jam y'all know the Meth Man take care of his fam 
That's what y'all better do 
Examine our skin we plannin to win 
Worldwide tell the people we be jammin again 

[Verse 2: Redman] 
Make way for Reggie Hammond 
I, dig 'em out then tie 'em up for randsome 
I, shoot at your feet make you start dancin 
I'm pissin on your picnics where ya campin 
Doctor got the ziplock from Ziggy 
When the zig zag roll I'll rip your zip code 
Got bitches fucked up off the hypno 
I tip toe, then wait till they bend over 
(There I go) Aiyyo money 
I got a mo ped in Jamaica sittin on twenties 
(Blaow!) Look out, guns in the air 
(Blaow!) Selecta guns in the air 
No Belvedere it's Tiger Bone to get it crackin 
Aiyyo dread right or wrong 
I'm a sinner, winner of the underground swimmers 
Eat dinner, in front of Bob Marley pin up 

[Chorus: Redman] 
I don't care about your blinb bling bling 
Over here we let them things ring 
BLAOW!!! Give it to me BLAOW!!! give it to me 
BLAOW!!! Shoot it up BLAOW!!! give it up 
I don't care about your blinb bling bling 
Over here we let them things ring 
BLAOW!!! Give it to me BLAOW!!! One time 
BLAOW!!! give it to me BLAOW!!! give it up 

[Verse 3: Damian "Jr. Gong" Marley] 
I neva wonda why so much ganja reach ya 
And dem a wonda how so much conquer feature 
Blunt dem so big a must fi bun it Bob and Peter 
Teach it like a teacher preach it like a preacher 
Put you in a fever 
Pussy couldn't style mi up plus no under achieve 
Gimme di rizla gimme di cup and a couple senorita 
Jr. Gong di veteran a trouble when mi reach ya 
DJ fi fi fan dem inna Grandtsand and di bleacha 
Jumpin off on di truck, you best believe yah 
Babylon a smell skunk and couldn't get mi neitha 
Well ever since a likkle ghetto yute dem get mi crippled 
So mi know seh babylon dem a go get a weopen 
Everytime when we hear some politician trippin 
When a di big ting promote I'm right there wid di clip in 
So just smile now yuh flip yuh likkle flippin lippin

Then mi buck up yuh face so far yuh don't know what's happenin 
Dem wonderin how yuh get so slim it's like yuh fat and go gym 
Get mi girl inna mi cabin and mi cabin stabbin

Hey! No pork caan cook inna mi kitchen

Well woman a tear off mi pants stitchen 
Natty dreadlocks inna di benz and have recline switchin 
If a bwoy nuh like dat him may end up missin 
Rastafari dun tell yuh don't listen
