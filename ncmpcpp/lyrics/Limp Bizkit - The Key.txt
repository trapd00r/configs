Check!
Shut the fuck up! (You shut the fuck up!)
Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you? (I ain't nobody)
That's the question, the question at hand.
Oh, man, fuck this. (I ain't nobody)
Fuck this!

You know, I lost my place a long time ago
about fifty fucking rhymes ago
I'm wrecking again
I'm seriously considering checking myself in
Locked inside this key chamber
There's millions of keys inside
but only one can stop my anger
and I'm not fading away, so I'll just have to die

Chorus:
Unlocking the doors in my mind
How many doors will I find?
I think I got the key
I guess I'll just try another if that's the key
Unlocking the doors in my mind
How many doors will I find?
I think I got the key
I guess I'll just try another if that's the key
