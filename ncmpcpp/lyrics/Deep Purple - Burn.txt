The sky is red, I don't understand
Past midnight, I still see the land
People are sayin' the woman is damned
She makes you burn with a wave of her hand
The city's ablaze, the town's on fire
The woman's flames are reaching higher
We were fools, we called her liar
All I hear is "Burn!"

I didn't believe she was devil's sperm
She said, "Curse you all, you'll never learn!
When I leave, there's no return."
The people laughed till she said, "Burn!"
Warning came, no one cared
Earth was shakin', we stood and stared
When it came, no one was spared
Still I hear "Burn!"

You know we had no time
We could not even try
You know we had no time

You know we had no time
We could not even try
You know we had no time

The sky is red, I don't understand
Past midnight, I still see the land
People are sayin' the woman is damned
She makes you burn with a wave of her hand
Warning came, no one cared
Earth was shakin, we stood and stared
When it came, no one was spared
Still I hear "Burn!"
