(Ja Rule) 
Em you claim your mother's a crackhead and Kim is a known slut 
So what's Hailie gonna be when she grows up? 

(Eminem - (Hailie Jade)) 
Hahaaaa, Yeah, come on 
G G G G G-Unit 
Hailie (What??) 
Come here baby 
Bring daddy his oscar (ok) 
Were gonna shove it up Ja Rule's ass (hehehe) 

(Swifty) 
I'm about to get rid of some hoes it's simple 
I put the Murder Inc with lead and I'm not talking about a pencil 
Look at what the fuck you dun got into 
I see you found your nitch you're just a bitch with a menstral 
Claiming you a murderer and spelt it wrong 
You but the E before the D because that's all you on 
You on Pac's dick (bitch) you a replica guy if he were still alive you would never get by 
All you do is cry bitch keep it real life is more than imitating niggas and eating pills 
And what kind of mothafucker ruins 3 deals that another nigga got you they didn't see skills 
And I ain't playing your a brother getting cheated 
And Ja Rule be praying on his cover cause he need it 
And you niggas hating shut your mouths 
It's just the real niggas ain't buying that shit you put out

(Obie) 
Doe Rae Me but we don't sing motherfuckers 
So Murda Inc do your thing motherfuckers 
You unleased on a team who expects nothing less then RnB coming from that regime 
Regime is a little extreme neck to neck with soldiers motherfucking marines 
Ja sold his soul to sing we have witnessed teen on the TV screen chase the dream 
Now that you embrace the green don't fuck with the triple beams 
You's a muther fucking actor slash Pac impersonating rapper 
Slash Billy Holiday how it happen? 
Artists with repituares saw him in action, Pac's assasination 
Def jam grabbed him, told him reinact him you'll go platinum 
They seen it for sure I know that Afeni Shakur don't enjoy Jeffrey Atkins 
Reinacting her boy saw him click clacking his toy 
Match and destroy Shady slash Aftermath in detroit motherfucker 

(Eminem) 
Doe Rae Me Fa So La Dee Da 
Don't play me cause your washed up, lost your spot 
Mama say mama sa Macosaca 
Ja quit playing now get off your not Tupac 
Doe Rae Me cause we're hot and you're not 
Going at me is the only shot you got 
Ja quit playing now get off your not Tupac 
You can get popped after all that shit you pop 

(Kon Artis) 
Now we can skip past the mean mugs, get to the slugs 
To grievence and the crying and intimate hugs 
We don't take you serious nigga you shook, 
You're half of a half wieght crook nigga get off X dick go sing a hook nigga 
And you can't replace the late great one and when your gone you'll only be the late fake one 
Nigga please stick the script before the guns stick to the clip 
And Benzino you ain't shit but a bitch, fucking old ass ignorant innocent looking senior citizen 
Built up slap you like renisanse sicitive wait a minute hold on 
Is it me or do we look like a banana with braids and clothes on 
A bitch made man now how you gonna connect 
with them short ass arms like a Tyranasaurous Rex 
You niggas can scream, holla and curse and go ahead and respond 
Pull that pen and pad up out of your purse 

(Proof) 
Slim didn't send Proof to get at the wankstas 
He told me to let loose and spit at the ganstas 
What up gotti were in this little war you pushed on 
Put your ear to the ground for stucky and bush stones
What's wrong? didn't think were strong with real niggas 
Roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us 
This real witness yall ain't caught the concept 
You're talking non sense to walking bomb threats 
Contacts were blown by Benzetta in the Source 
Threatning at the boss you're gonna see me on your porch 
Now Irv got the nerse to try serve on us 
But Detroit niggas curve and they stirs to bust 

(Kuniva) 
Do I gotta get my nigga bugz, punks like you get beat up 
Stomped unconscience and smacked with the heater 
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils 
With dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina 
Who's behind ya? Caddillac, Pac or that transvestite that dress like a Lil Kim Fox 
Your just like a little wind box when I press tight on the trigger of this glock 
That's right on the little shit you got left to help you eat 
You not Pac's songs without laws will help you sleep 
You got shot in your video trying to mock pac your mockavelli get your own identity 

(Eminem) 
Doe Rae Me Fa So La Dee Da 
(Don't EVER say my lil girls name in a song again) 
Don't play me cause your washed up, lost your spot 
Mama say mama sa Macosaca 
(Fucking punk pussy, BITCH!) 
Ja quit playing now get off your not Tupac 
Doe Rae Me cause we're hot and you're not 
(Im'a fuck you up boy) 
Going at me is the only shot you got 
(Never again in your mother fucking life) 
Ja quit playing now get off your not Tupac 
(Gonna shoot the shit outa you little fucking midgits, Hailie will whip your mother fucking asses) 
You can get popped after all that shit you pop
