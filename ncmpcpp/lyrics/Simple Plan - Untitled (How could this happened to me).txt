I open my eyes 
I try to see but I'm blinded by the white light 
I can't remember how 
I can't remember why 
I'm lying here tonight 

And I can't stand the pain 
And I can't make it go away 
No I can't stand the pain 

How could this happen to me 
I've made my mistakes 
I've got no where to run 
The night goes on 
As I'm fading away 
I'm sick of this life 
I just wanna scream 
How could this happen to me 

Everybody's screaming 
I try to make a sound but no one hears me 
I'm slipping off the edge 
I'm hanging by a thread 
I wanna start this over again 

So I try to hold onto a time when nothing mattered 
And I can't explain what happened 
And I can't erase the things that I've done 
No I can't 

How could this happen to me 
I've made my mistakes 
I've got no where to run 
The night goes on 
As I'm fading away 
I'm sick of this life 
I just wanna scream 
How could this happen to me 

I've made my mistakes 
I've got no where to run 
The night goes on 
As I'm fading away 
I'm sick of this life 
I just wanna scream 
How could this happen to me
