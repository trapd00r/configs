Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo..... 
[laughs] 
we go where we like, 
we got over time, 
we get paid 2 rattle our, chains 

we go in the back, 
paint our money black, 
spend it on the enemy 

sleeping in the church, 
riding in the dirt, 
put a banner over my grave 

Make a body work, 
make a begger hurt, 
sell me sumthing big and untamed 

[Chorus] 

Now our time, real good time, 
(doo doo doo doo doo doo..) 

now our time, a real good time 
(doo doo doo doo doo doo..) 

now our time, (SAID NOW OUR TIME), 
a real good time (ITS A REALLY GOOD TIME!) 

HEY AAAAAAA BE ALL MINE 

we know how 2 pray, 
party everyday, 
make our desillation unsafe......... 
(not 2 sure if unsafe is the rite word) 

riding in a rut, 
till the powers cut, 
we dont even have a good name 

sleeping in the church, 
riding in the dirt, 
put a banner over my grave 

Make a body work, 
make a begger hurt, 
sell me sumthing big and untamed 

[Chorus] 

...Now our time, real good time, oohh 
(doo doo doo doo doo doo..) 
now our time, a real good time 
(doo doo........) 
now our time, (NOW IT OUR TIME), a real good time
