Nigga, you need to stop snitchin'
All that yip-yappin' and jaw-jackin'
Nigga, if you scared, go to church
You knew the job was dangerous when you took it

What up? It's the big boss Dogg
Snoop D O double G, Eastside L.B.C.
And I'm bobbin' to the beat of my O.G. homeboy Ice Cube
And I'm C-walkin' on the muthafuckin' concrete

Yo' if you're fucked up, put your cups up
Ice Cube and Snoop Dogg, nigga what's up?

Yo, it's either thank you, or it's fuck you

And if you walk by nigga, I'ma knock fire nigga

If you scared, go to church, we gon' hit you where it hurts
That don't work, we'll put you in the dirt
'Cause a whole lot of rappers make a whole lot of noise (Hey)
Lyrics full of steroids, niggas paranoid (Hey)
And when you get that blowup, it make you throw up
When you realize your favorite rapper ain't got no nuts

If you a scared motherfucker go to church (Go to church)
If you a gutter motherfucker do your dirt (A do your dirt)
If you a down motherfucker put in work (A put in work)
IF you a crazy motherfucker go berzerk (A go berserk)

Click clackin', pistol-packin', Crip raggin' folio
Who the only nigga in the club with the toolio
You ain't know? Yeah you did; there it was, there it is
"Is that Coolio?" Naw bitch, let me in
Jibba-jabba snatcher get at ya, spit at actors and rappers
Hang out with kidnappers and jackers
Make money off crackers; can you imagine how I keep shit crackin'?
It's the big boss Dogg, I'm back in action and smashin'
I flash with the bling I surpass the supreme
You don't really wanna have a clash with my team
I mix hash with the green I'm the, last of the kings
If I got a bitch with me, she got ass in them jeans
Rollin' through yo' neighborhood, my Cadillac so clean
Servin' all you suckers 'cause you all dope fiends

Never question the size of Ice Cube's balls.
