I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When you're here
All those words, they seem to slip away

When I get near you
The games begin to drag me down
It's all right
I'll make you maybe next time around

But if I seem to act unkind
It's only me
It's not my mind
That is confusing things

I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever
I've got time

Sometimes I wish I knew you well
Then I could speak my mind
And tell you
Maybe you'd understand

I want to tell you
I feel hung up and I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever
I've got time

I've got time
