I am a little bit of loneliness, a little bit of disregard
A handful of complaints
But I can't help the fact that everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want, what I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do 
I can't convince you to just believe this is real
So I let go watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here because you're all that I got

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

I am a little bit insecure, a little unconfident
Because you don't understand
I do what I can, but sometimes I don't make sense
I am what you never want to say, but I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do
I can't convince you for once just to hear me out
So I let go, watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here because you're all that I got

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

No, hear me out now
You're going to listen to me like it or not
Right now
Hear me out now
You're going listen to me like it or not
Right now

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
I can't feel
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
