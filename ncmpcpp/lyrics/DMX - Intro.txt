Ya just don't listen 
Why must you be hard headed 
Tried to explain, but ya didn't hear me though 
Ya know, grrrrrr 

Uh 
One two one two, come through run through 
Gun who, oh you don't know what the gun do 
Some do, those that know are real quiet 
Let me think you wanna try it, fuck around and start a riot 
Niggas gonna buy it, regardless because I'm the hardest 
rap artist and I'ma start this 
Shit up foreal, get up and feel, my words 
I make herbs split up and squeal 
Ill is all I've been hearin lately 
Niggaz hate me, wanna duck tape me and make me 
put their brains on the wall, when I brawl 
Too late for that 911 call 
Niggaz stay beefin but a lot of them bluffin 
But not me because I'ma nigga that can get out of them cuffs 
You think a lot of them tough 
Not just for frotin 
When I hit them niggaz like 'What you want?' 
the battle turns into a hunt 
With the dog right behind niggaz chasin em down 
We all knew that you was pussy 
but I'm tastin it now 
And never give a dog blood 
because raw blood 
I have a dog like one bitin whatever 
All up in ya gut 
Give it to them raw like that 
and ain't no love I do em all like that 
Four right up in they back 
Clak Clak 
Close your eyes baby, it's over 
Forget it, happened in front off your buildin but 
nobody knows who did it

Niggas is pussy 
Keep me runnin from the werewolf, owww 
Howling at the moon on the roof 
Eh, ah, no, get em 
Ten niggas on him, hope God's with him 
Give me the bat, let me split him 
I'll have em where the pillow and the casket won't fit him 
Only reason I did him, he wouldn't fight back 
Trieed to strike back 
Left him like that, layin up with the white hat 
Gettin right back at ya when I snatch ya 
up out the grave, nuthin but bones and ashes 
Hittin niggaz with gashes to the head 
Straight to the white meat but the street stay red 
But this girl gave me head for free 
Cause they see, who I'ma be by like 2003 
That Nigga D took it there 
He thought it was a joke 
He went through like 20 G's and thought that 
I was broke, stupid 
That's what you get for thinkin and eventually 
found that's what you get for stinkin 
Blowin up the spot when you rot 
plus if it gets hot they know you dipped 
for four squared blocks 
Hit em with the ox to the grill 
Eh, ah, kill nigga kill 
Yet still they don't know I'ma rob who 
That dog DMX is a muthafuckin problem
