I was wrong to think that I could ever trust in you,
I was wrong to think that you might want to trust me, too.
Here I am, here I am,
Here I stand,
Here I am, here I am, here I am, here I stand.

I was wrong to think that I could ever love in you,
I was wrong to think that you might want to love me, too.

Here I am, here I am,
Here I stand,
Here I am, here I am, here I am, here I stand.

So where the hell are you?
So where the hell are you?
So where are you when I need someone, too?
I'm tired of needing you.
