I went to die in a seaside hotel
Lanes of memory paved by sweet frozen moments

Deathbed memories of home
Never let me go

Every little memory resting calm in me
Resting in a dream
Smiling back at me
The faces of the past keep calling me to come back home
To caress the river with awe
Within there's every little memory resting calm with me
Resting in a dream
Smiling back at me
The faces of the past keep calling me to come back home
Rest calm and remember me

You are the moon pulling my black waters
You are the land in my dark closet

Stay by my side until it all goes dark forever
When silent the silence comes closer

Deathbed memories of home
Never let me go

Within there's every little memory resting calm with me
Resting in a dream
Smiling back at me
The faces of the past keep calling me to come back home
To caress the river with awe
Within there's every little memory resting calm with me
Resting in a dream
Smiling back at me
The faces of the past keep calling me to come back home
Rest calm and remember me

Every little memory
Resting calm in me
Resting in a dream
Smiling back at me
Resting in a dream
Calling me to come back home
To caress the river with awe

Every little memory
Resting calm in me
Resting in a dream
Smiling back at me
Resting in a dream
Calling me to come back home
Rest calm and remember me

Within there's every little memory resting calm with me
Resting in a dream
Smiling back at me
The faces of the past keep calling me to come back home
To caress the river with awe
Within there's every little memory resting calm with me
Resting in a dream
Smiling back at me
The faces of the past keep calling me to come back home
Rest calm and remember me
