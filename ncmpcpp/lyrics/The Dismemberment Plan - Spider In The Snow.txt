The only thing worse than bad memories 
Is no memories at all 
From the age of 20 to 22 I had five friends 
None of whose names I can recall 
And as I would walk down K Street to some temping job 
As winter froze the life out of fall 
Yeah, I must've been having a ball, yeah
 
Different scene outside your window now 
Same VCR, same cats 
Different people at the very same job 
Similar alley, different rats 
The trash goes out on a Tuesday now 
You got to make a note about that 
Yeah, this time you're where it's at, yeah
 
You can't say it but I know that it's in there 
You don't know it but I know that you're scared 
Obvious and lonely—a spider in the snow 

Now you find the very same pit still yawns 
Deep down within the very same gut 
The very same ghosts still seem to haunt you down 
Down those lines you always tried to cut 
You thought you just might need a little change 
And now you find you got nothing but 
How can a body move the speed of light 
And still find itself in such a rut? 

You can't say it but I know that it's in there 
You don't know it but I know that you're scared 
Obvious and lonely—afraid to not let go 
You can't say it but I know it's in there 
You don't know it but I know that you're scared 
Obvious and lonely—a spider in the snow
