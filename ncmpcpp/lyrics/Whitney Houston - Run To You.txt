I know that when you look at me
There's so much that you just don't see
But if you would only take the time
I know in my heart you'd find
A girl who's scared sometimes
Who isn't always strong
Can't you see the hurt in me?
I feel so all alone

[Chorus:]
I want to run to you (oooh)
I want to run to you (oooh)
Won't you hold me in your arms 
And keep me safe from harm
I want to run to you (oooh)
But if I come to you (oooh)
Tell me, will you stay or will you run away

Each day, each day I play the role
Of someone always in control
But at night I come home and turn the key
There's nobody there, no one cares for me 
What's the sense of trying hard to find your dreams
Without someone to share it with
Tell me what does it mean?

[Chorus]

I need you here
I need you here to wipe away my tears
To kiss away my fears
If you only knew how much...

[Chorus]
