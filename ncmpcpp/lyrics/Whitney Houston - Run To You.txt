I know that when you look at me
There's so much that you just don't see
But if you would only take the time
I know in my heart you'd find
Oh, a girl, who's scared sometimes
Who isn't always strong
Can't you see the hurt in me
I feel so all alone

I wanna run to you
I wanna run to you
Won't ya hold me in your arms and keep me safe from harm
I wanna run to you
But if I come to you
Tell me will you stay
Or will you run away

Each day, each day I play the role
Of someone always in control
But at night I come home and turn the key
There's nobody there, no one cares for me
Oh woah what's the sense of trying hard to find your dreams
Without someone to share them with
Tell me what does it mean

I wanna run to you
I wanna run to you
Won't ya hold me in your arms and keep me safe from harm
I wanna run to you
But if I come to you
Tell me will you stay
Or will you run away

Run away, no
I need you here I need you here to wipe away my tears
To kiss away my fears
No if you only knew how much I wanna run to you
Ya know I wanna run to you
Won't ya hold me in your arms and keep me safe from harm
I wanna run to you
But if I come to you
Tell me will you stay
Or will you run away
