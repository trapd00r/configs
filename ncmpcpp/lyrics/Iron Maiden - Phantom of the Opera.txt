I've been looking so long for you, now; you won't get away from my grasp
You've been living so long in hiding in hiding behind that false mask
And you know and I know that you ain't got long now to last
Your looks and your feelings are just the remains of your past

You're standing in the wings; there, you wait for the curtain to fall
Knowing the terror and holding you have on us all
Yeah, I know that you're gonna scratch me, maim me, and maul
You know I'm helpless from your mesmerizing catcall

Keep your distance; walk away, don't take his bait
Don't you stray, don't fade away
Watch your step; he's out to get you, come what may
Don't you stray from the narrow way

I'm running and hiding in my dreams; you're always there
You're the Phantom of the Opera; you're the devil; you're just out to scare 
You damaged my mind and my soul; it just floats through the air
Haunt me, you taunt me; you torture me back at your lair!
