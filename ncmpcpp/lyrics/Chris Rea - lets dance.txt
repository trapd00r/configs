Send "Let's Dance" Ringtone to your Cell When you sing of the joy only love can bring
Heaven knows it's in my heart and my soul
We're caught in a world full of tears
So many bad times and fears
So while there's a chance and you're near

Let's dance
Let's dance

There's a world far away from the one we see
There's a dream I will never let go
One thing is certainly true
This moment's for me and for you
So while there's not a thing that we can do

Well, Let's dance
Let's dance
 Send "Let's Dance" Ringtone to your Cell
