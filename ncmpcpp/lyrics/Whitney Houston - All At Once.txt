All at once
I finally took a moment
And I'm realizing that
You're not coming back
And it finally hit me
All at once

All at once
I started counting teardrops
And at least a million fell
My eyes began to swell
And all my dreams were
Shattered all at once

Ever since I met you
You're the only love I've known
And I can't forget you
Though I must face it all alone

All at once
I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you'd come back to me
And that's all that matters now

All at once
I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Holding on to memories
And it hurts me more than you know
So much more than it shows
All at once

All at once
I looked around and found
That you were with another love
In someone else's arms
And all my dreams were shattered
All at once

All at once
The smile that used to greet me
Brightened someone else's day
She took your smile away
And left me with just memories
All at once

Ever since I met you
You're the only love I've known
And I can't forget you
Though I must face it all alone

All at once
I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you'd come back to me
And that's all the matters now

All at once
I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Holding on to memories
And it hurts me more than you know
So much more than it shows
All at once

All at once
I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Holding on to memories
And it hurts me more than you know
So much more than it shows
All at once

And that's all the matters now
All at once
I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you'd come back to me
And it hurts me more than you know
All at once
