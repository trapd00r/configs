 The rap game, hip hop 101
 The hardest nine to five you'll ever have
 You can't learn this shit in no history book
 You ready to rap motherfucker?
 You ready to sell your soul? hahaha
 The rap game will fuck you up
 
 [Swifty McVay]
 I'ma disrupted nigga, you made me crazy
 You shoulda slayed me as a baby
 Behavin' shadier than Wes Craven 
 And you ain't even gotta pay me
 I take pleasure of layin' a nigga down daily
 You face me, punk it's over, you'll faint fast
 I've never fucked up to where I can't whoop ya ass
 You'll neck'll get snapped with bare hands, fuck music
 Is he rappin'? It's cool but fools, just don't confuse it
 What happens: these dudes get rude then I lose it
 I'm scandalous, I blow ya two niggas off the atlas
 With a gat that's bigger than Godzilla's back nigga
 You are not realer, in fact you're feel the effects
 Of a crack dealer, y'all presidents since he smacked
 And got a mack 10 with it, so I ain't gotta rap
 But I'm thankful for that, don't mistakin' me black
 Cuz you'll be stankin' in the back of a fuckin' Cadillac
 
 [Eminem]
 I'ma get snuffed, cuz I ain't said enough to pipe down
 I pipe down, when the (White House) just wiped out
 When I see that little (Cheney) dike get sniped out
 Lights out, bitch adios, goodnight [gunshot] (AHH!)
 Now put that in ya little pipe and bite down
 Think for a minute cuz the hype just died down
 That I won't go up in the Oval Office right now
 And flip whatever ain't tied down upside down
 I'm all for America, fuck the government
 Tell that C. Delores Tucker slut to suck a dick
 Motherfuck ducked, what the fuck? son of a bitch
 Take away my gun, I'm gonna tuck some other shit
 Can't tell me shit about the tricks of this trade
 Switchblade, with a little switch to switch blades
 And switch from a six to a sixteen inch blade
 Shit's like a samurai sword or sensai
 Shit just don't change to this day
 I'm this way, still tell that utsl-ay itchb-ay
 Ucks-ay my ikcd-ay, 'scuse my igp-ay atinl-ay
 But uckf-ay you igp-ay
 
 [Chorus: 50 Cent (sung)]
 This rap game, this rap game
 I ain't sellin' my soul for this rap game
 And I ain't diggin' no hole for this rap game
 Man, I'm tellin' you, no it ain't happening
 This rap game, this rap game
 I ain't sellin' my soul for this rap game
 I ain't diggin' no hole for this rap game
 This rap game, this rap game
 
 [Kon Artist]
 I wouldn't wanna be drinkin', drowned in my own inequity
 But fucked that I'ma rap 'til y'all all get sick of me
 And clutch my nuts sack and spit all who pick at me
 A pitt and rott mix, fuck the dogs you sic on me
 I'm sayin' you motherfuckers don't know us, quit playin'
 If I'm broke, then I'm breakin' up in the place where you layin'
 You know, same shit every nigga done in his life
 I look at this, why speak on when I want when I write
 So why should I ever fear another man
 If he bleed like I bleed, take a piss and he stand?
 OK, you win, you can say we can't rap
 But no Source never made me not buy an album when they say it was whack
 
 [Kuniva]
 I walk in that party and just start bussin' [gunshots and screaming]
 Right after I hear the last verse of "Self Destruction"
 This liquor makes me wanna blast the chrome
 To let you know +The Time+ without Morris Day and Jerome (nigga)
 I'm low down and shifty, quickly call Swifty 
 To do a drive-by on the tenth speed with 50
 Ya feelin' lucky? Squeeze
 I catch you outside of Chuckie Cheese
 With ya seed, you be an unlucky G
 My lifestyle is unstable, a partyin' addict
 They said no fightin' in the club so I brought me a 'matic
 Coughin' the static, I jump niggas, call me a rabbit
 Poppin' the tablet and guns that saw you in half
 
 [Chorus: 50 Cent (sung)]
 Believe me, we run this rap shit, fo sheezy
 Make makin' millions look easy
 Everywhere you turn you see me, you hear me
 Believe me, before you see my pistol in 3-D
 No time to call a peace treaty
 Dial 911 cuz you need the- police to help you believe me
 
 [Proof]
 I snatch the chalk from the sidewalk and piss on the curb
 This is absurd, these street niggas twistin' my words
 We finally could "Say Goodbye to Hollywood"
 Cuz Proof and Shyne man shit nothin' in common
 The nastiest band with gas in each hand
 We never bow down to be a flash in the pan
 No remorse, fuck ya stature dog
 Nothin' to do with hands when I clap at y'all
 Put your jaw on the ground with the four and the pound
 Then I'm gone outta town 'fore the law come around
 So we can battle with raps, we can battle with gats
 Matter of fact, we can battle for plaques (This rap game)
 
 [Bizarre]
 I'm too fuckin' retarded
 I don't give a fuck about my dick
 That's why I'm datin' Lorraina Bobbet
 My crew had an argument, who was the largest
 Now they all is dead and I roll as a solo artist
 Plus I made all the beats and wrote all the raps
 Well I really didn't, but I did accordin' to this contract
 I was thrown in the snow with nowhere to go
 Freezin' 20 below, forced to join Bel Biv Devoe
 My little girl, she shouldn't listen to these lyrics
 That's why I glued her headphones to her ear to make sure she hear it
 If rap don't work, I'm startin' a group with Garth Brooks
 Hahahaha, 50 sing the hook
 
 [Chorus: 50 Cent (sung)]
 This rap game, this rap game
 I ain't sellin' my soul for this rap game
 And I ain't diggin' no hole for this rap game
 Man, I'm tellin' you, know it ain't happening
 This rap game, this rap game
 I ain't sellin' my soul for this rap game
 I ain't diggin' no hole for this rap game
 This rap game, this rap game
