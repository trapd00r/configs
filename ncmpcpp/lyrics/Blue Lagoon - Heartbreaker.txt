I got to say it and it's hard for me 
You got me cryin' like I thought I would never be 
Love is believin' but you let me down 
How can I love you when you ain't around 
And I ..... 

Get to the morning and you never call 
Love should be ev'rything or not at all 
And it don't matter what ever you do 
I made a life out of lovin' you 

Only to find any dream that I follow is dying 
I'm cryin' in the rain 
I could be searchin' my world for a love everlasting 
Feeling no pain, when will we meet again 

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker 
Is it a lesson that I never knew 
Gotta get out of the spell that I'm under 
My love for you 
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker 
When I was bein' what you want me to be 
Suddenly ev'rything I ever wanted has passed me by 
This world may end 
Not you and I 

My love is stronger than the universe 
My soul is cryin' for you 

And that can not be reversed 
You made the rules and you could not see 
You made a life out of hurtin' me 

Out of my mind , 
I am held by the power of you love 
Tell me when do we try 
Or should we say goodbye 

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker 
When I was bein' what you want me to be 
Suddenly ev'rything I ever wanted has passed me by 

(break) 

Ohhh, 
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker 
Is it a lesson that I never knew 
Suddenly ev'rything I ever wanted 
My love for you , Ooh.... 

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker 
When I was bein' what you want me to be 
Suddenly ev'rything I ever wanted has passed me by (fade)
