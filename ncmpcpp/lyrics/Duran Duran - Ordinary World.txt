Came in from a rainy Thursday on the avenue
Thought I heard you talking softly
I turned on the lights, the TV and the radio
Still, I can't escape the ghost of you
What has happened to it all?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is the life that I recognize?
Gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world,
Somehow I have to find
And, as I try to make my way to the ordinary world,
I will learn to survive

Passion or coincidence once prompted you to say
"Pride will tear us both apart"
Well, now, pride's gone out the window cross the rooftops, run away,
Left me in the vacuum of my heart
What is happening to me?
Crazy, some'd say,
Where is my friend when I need you most?
Gone away

But, I won't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world,
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way, to the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Papers in the roadside tell of suffering and greed
Here today, forgot tomorrow
Ooh, here besides the news of holy war and holy need
Ours is just a little sorrowed talk

(Just blown away...)

And I don't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world,
Somehow I have to find
And, as I try to make my way to the ordinary world,
I will learn to survive

Every world, is my world (I will learn to survive)
Any world, is my world  (I will learn to survive)

Any world, is my world
Every world is my world
