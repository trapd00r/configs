I stand at your gate,
and the song that I sing is of moonlight.
I stand, and I wait
for the touch of your hand in the June night.
The roses are sighing
a moonlight serenade.

The stars are aglow,
and tonight, how their light sets me dreaming.
My love, do you know
that your eyes are like stars brightly beaming?
I bring you, and I sing you
a moonlight serenade.

Let us stay till break of day
in love's valley of dreams.
Just you and I, a summer sky,
a heavenly breeze, kiss in the trees.

So don't let me wait-
come to me tenderly in the June night.
I stand at your gate
and I sing you a song in the moonlight.
A love song, my darling-
a moonlight serenade.
