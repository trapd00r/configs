You took a part of me that I really miss
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this
You told yourself a lie, that's alright mama, I told myself one too
I'm trying to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you

You took the silver, you took the gold
You left me standing out in the cold
People ask about you, I didn't tell them everything I knew
Well I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you

I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep
Did so many things I never did intend to do
Well I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you

I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low
I need every bit of it for the places that I go
Sometimes I wonder just what it's all coming to
Well I'm tryin' to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you

Well I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think
Feel like talking to somebody but I just don't know who
Well, I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you

Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet"
I said, "That's alright mama, you... you do what you gotta do"
Well, I'm tryin' to get closer, I'm still a million miles from you

Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months
And I'll rock you too
I'm tryin' to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you

Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard
I'm sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word
I know plenty of people, put me up for a day or two
Yes, I'm tryin' to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you
