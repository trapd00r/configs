So
So you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell
Blue skies from pain

Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees? 
Hot air for a cool breeze?

Cold comfort for change?
Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish
How I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year

Running over the same old ground
What have we found?
The same old fears
Wish you were here
