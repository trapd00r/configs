Now the time has come to speak
I was not able
And water through a rusted pipe
Could make the sense that I do


Gurgle, mutter
Hiss, stutter
Moan the words like water
Rush and foam and choke


Having waited
This long of a winter
I fear I only
Croak and sigh


Somewhere deep within
Hear the creak
That lets the tale begin


Now the time has come to move
I was not able
Water through a rusted pipe
Could make the moves that I do


Stagger, stumble
Trip, fumble
I fear I only
Slip and slide


Somewhere deep within
Hear the creak
That lets the tale begin


Somewhere deep within
Hear the creak
That lets the tale begin
