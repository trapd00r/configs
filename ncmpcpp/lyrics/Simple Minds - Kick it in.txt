Love gives me poetry
Stays up all night and puts a curse on me
Oh anything you want
Turn around and I'll take you there
I know it's going to be
Take your shackles off o' me
This city's gone, I'm gone over there

Kick it in, kick it in
Build it up and burn it down again
Kick it in, kick it in
Burn down to the ground
Kick it in, kick it in
Tell me about this place you've been
I don't want it there's a fever going around

Take a walk down town
See what's going on
If you want to find a hidden key
There's nothing here on me
Any city, anywhere
Any colour I don't care
You belong to me
And that's the way it's gonna be

Kick it in, kick it in

Yeah kick it in, kick it in
Raise it up and let it live again
Feel your body shake and take off
You can lie but keep it in
Keep me down here wondering
So what's it going to be
Come on in
I like the shape you're in
You keep me wondering, wondering, wondering

Eyes upon you black and brown
Spread your love all over town
Give me fire, body heat
Say hello to me
I want to go anywhere
Any colour I don't care
Don't believe in all you see
And don't get caught

Kick it in, kick it in
Tell me about this love you've been
Kick it in, kick it in
Turn this life around
Kick it in, kick it in
Shake the ghosts from deep within
Close the door down
Don't let the demons in

Kick it in, kick it in
I only want to be your friend
Put your hands in my hand
And take off with me

Listen baby, I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home
Come on walk with me

Cause I know what I see
Kick it in
Kick it in, kick it in
Tell me 'bout the place you're in
I've got a new gold dream
I'm moving on, I'm moving on
You're moving on, you're moving on
You're moving on, yeah
Kick it in, kick it in
I'm moving on
