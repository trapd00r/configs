Do you like this? 
This place that I'm bringing you to?
Because I do
Oh, my God.

I know this place
It's still a secret
And I don't think you've ever been
It's kinda hard
To find the entrance
You need some juice
But you'll love it once you get in
This special place it's in the basement
You have to work your way around
The place is hot and then it's pumping
So are you ready to go down?

So it's over to you now
So it's over to you now (now, now, yeah)
And it's over to you now
Can't you see what I'm thinking-king-king?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

If you behave
You might be chosen
Just read it far
And it tells you how to get there
And when you come
You might be stunned
So baby what'chu waiting for?

So it's over to you now
So it's over to you now (now, now, yeah)
And it's over to you now
Can't you see what I'm thinking-king-king?
So it's over to you now
So it's over to you now (now, now, yeah)
And it's over to you now
Can't you see what I'm thinking-king-king?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Do you like this?
This place that I'm bringing you to?
Do you feel that? Huh? [Giggles]
Do like that?
I thought you would. 
'Cause I do.
Oh, my God 

So it's over to you now
So it's over to you now (now, now, yeah)
And it's over to you now
Can't you see what I'm thinking-king-king?
So it's over to you now
So it's over to you now (now, now, yeah)
And it's over to you now
Can't you see what I'm thinking-king-king?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah..

Oh, my God
