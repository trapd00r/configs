Just cause I love my niggas, (Ruff Ryders)
I shed blood for my niggas. (Ryde or die)
Let a nigga holla, "Where my niggas?" (Get down or lay down)
All I wanna hear is, "Right here my niggas."
(We here nigga) &lt;echoes&gt;

You won't take this from me baby!
You will not take this from me baby!
Ya know grrrrr

My niggas some niggas that you don't wanna try
My niggas some niggas that's really do or die
My niggas will have you cowards ready to cry
My niggas will fry my niggas will rob
My niggas keep niggas on they fuckin' job
My niggas know what it's like when shit gettin' hard
My niggas stay pullin' you other niggas cards
My niggas It's God my niggas we'll shine
My niggas just knew it was a matter of time
My niggas let me know to keep fuckin' with the rhymes
My niggas ain't no longer livin' with crime
My niggas is fine my niggas is good
My niggas keep you niggas knocking on wood
My niggas know how to take it back to the hood
My niggas will put you down right where you stood
My niggas they could my niggas they will
My niggas take you straight to the back & get ill
My niggas give it straight to the bank when we kill
My niggas put niggas on ice til they chill
My niggas is still my niggas is dogs my niggas (echoes)
