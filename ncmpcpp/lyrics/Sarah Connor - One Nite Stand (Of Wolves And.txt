F/ Wyclef Jean

Intro:
Sarah Connor it's an honour 
Wyclef &shy; bounce &shy; 
One nite stand 
C'mon 

Chorus:
Love ya baby, drive me crazy 
Let me be your sugar daddy 
Looked into my eyes, 
I was convinced 
That he's real, real 

Girlfriend 
Ever had a boyfriend 
Looked to be your best friend 
Turned out to be a 
One nite stand 

He Loves Me 
(I Love Ya) 
He loves me not 
He screams my name in bed 
Makes me feel so hot 
But once he's out the door 
He's already forgot 
The promises he made 
At the break of light (break of light) 
To Love Me 
Protect me 
Not leave me 
Or hurt me 

I was so foolish 
And so blind to see 
That all he wanted to do 
Was to use me 

Let's Go 

Chorus
Love ya baby, drive me crazy 
Let me be your sugar daddy 
Looked into my eyes, 
I was convince 
That he's real, real 

Girlfriend 
Ever had a boyfriend 
Looked to be your best friend 
Turned out to be a 
One nite stand 
One nite stand 

Verse 2
I Love him &shy; I love him not 
I still scream his name in my bed at night (Wyclef) 
But once he's out the door 
He's already forgot 
The promises he made at the break of light (break of light) 
He said he's needing me, 
But he's misleading me- sayin' he loves me, 
But he's mistreating me 

I was so foolish 
And so blind to see 
That all he wanted to do 
Was to use me 

Let's Go, Let's Go 

Chorus
Love ya baby, drive me crazy 
Let me be your sugar daddy 
Looked into my eyes, 
I was convinced 
That he's real, real 

Girlfriend 
Ever had a boyfriend 
Looked to be your best friend 
Turned out to be a 
One nite stand 

But don't feel sad, bad, mad 
Cause I've too been 
Through the rain 
And I can feel your pain 
Feel it 
Mama told me 
There'd be days like these 
So I'm telling you ladies 

Take me to the bridge, Sarah Connor! 

Bridge:
Sitting in my room I‘m all alone 
You ain't gotta do that girl 
My friends think I'm crazy 
Cause I'm waiting for your call 
Was it a dream or reality 
(When you said) 

When you said you'd be 
With me 
Oh Oh Oh 
For eternity 
Oh Oh Oh 

Wyclef Part
Wyclef and Sarah Connor 
Holler, lend me your ears 
This is the wickedest combination 
Since Sonny and Cher 
Say here girl, 
Take these dozens of roses 
And let me part the red sea 
Like I was Moses 
Ah I 
Love Is Love 
Two wrongs don't make it right 
So let's make love in the dark 
Til we break daylight 
Then hit the autobahn 
You and me in a Ferrari 
Fall asleep in Germany, 
Then wake up in New York City 

Chorus
Love ya baby, drive me crazy 
Let me be your sugar daddy 
Looked into my eyes, 
I was convinced 
That he's real, real 

Girlfriend 
Ever had a boyfriend 
Looked to be your best friend 
Turned out to be a 
One nite stand 

But don't feel sad, bad, mad 
Cause I've too been 
Through the rain 
And I can feel your pain 
feel it 
Mama told me 
There'd be days like these 
So I'm telling you ladies 
Watch out for the wolves 
That be dressed like sheep 

Bounce now, wolves bounce now 
Like sheep 
Watch out for the wolves wolves 
That be dressed like sheep 
C'mon bounce now, wolves bounce now 
Like sheep 
Like sheep, babe 
C'mon bounce now, wolves bounce now 
Like sheep 
Watch out for the wolves wolves 
One nite stand 
Bounce now 
Wolves bounce now

Wolves bounce now 
Like sheep 
Bounce now 
Watch out for the wolves wolves
