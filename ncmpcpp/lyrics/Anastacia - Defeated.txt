Selling stories that were overrated in this world so complicated
Felt so right, you tried to make it wrong
Why can't we all just get along
From the start something wasn't right
I used to cry myself to sleep at night
Told myself stand up be strong
This kind of phase doesn't last for long

Every time you try to knock me down, gonna pick my back up off the ground
The battle never ends

You can tear me apart 
You can rip me to pieces
Try breaking me down
But I'll never be beaten
You can say that you won but I'll never believe it
Cos I can't be defeated

Made a mistake swore Ill never repeat it
Lost my heart for a second but it never stopped beating
I smile through the tears so the way that I see it
I can't be defeated

There are times that I couldn't take it
Never felt so violated
At the risk of sounding so cliché
I just gotta call a spade a spade
Hurts me right to the core
I can't take this anymore
Getting tired of the same old song
Final chorus, now I'm moving on

Things aint fair in love in war
Never been the kind to be ignored
Tried to push me to the edge

You can tear me apart 
You can rip me to pieces
Try breaking me down
But I'll never be beaten
You can say that you won but I'll never believe it
Cos I can't be defeated

Made a mistake swore Ill never repeat it
Lost my heart for a second but it never stopped beating
I smile through the tears so the way that I see it
I can't be defeated

Yeah
Nothing is impossible
Nothing is unreachable
If you only believe then you get what you need
So keep on holdin on

You can tear me apart 
You can rip me to pieces
Try breaking me down
But I'll never be beaten
You can say that you won but I'll never believe it
Cos I can't be defeated

Made a mistake swore Ill never repeat it
Lost my heart for a second but it never stopped beating
I smile through the tears so the way that I see it
I can't be defeated
