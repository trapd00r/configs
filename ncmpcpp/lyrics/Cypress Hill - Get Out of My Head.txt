uh..uh...yeah....
These voices up in my head... 

All these voices up in my head
Makin me dread, when I sleep at night 
Visons of people with evil intensions wanna fly my sight 
Visons are changin, engagin, and ragin', I'm in a stage and a fight 
Listen, the system is pissin' me off, you wanna feel my pipe 
Fingers pointed, annointed people, day better up to the knight 
Whispers, darkness the hardest, time ain't never gonna feel alright 
Feelin' my soul in the hole, 
I can't breathe, and I'm frightened for my life 
Think I need help or I dwell in hell, cuz I got a grip too tight! 

(Chorus)
Will you ever get out of my head? (4X)

Through every dimension as tension ahead, I gotta go my main
Dreams are like beans up like coming through my brain, 
then I know I'm baked
For every single minute that's in it, each and every brand new day
Denial of trial I'm vile, whatever that bullshit they say
I'm sinking so low in my self, help me gain, never give no break
Confusion is usin me sinkin me up, now the sky's all grey
I'm blazin and liftin my mind with kite, let me hit that J
Holding, controlling my self over, but the shit won't stay!

(Chorus) (w/ Sen Dog)
Will you ever get out of my head?
Will you ever get out of my head?
Will you ever get out of my head?
Will you ever get out of my head? (Will you ever get out of my head!)
Will you ever get out of my head? ( Will you ever get out of my head!)
Will you ever get out of my head? (Will you ever get out of my head!)
Will you ever get out of my head? (Will you ever get out of my head!)
