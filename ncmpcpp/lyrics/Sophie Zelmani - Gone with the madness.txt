I'm gonna bring a bottle of wine
Won't change the truth,
just to fit our time
Disappointed, it was a man
hidden in the woods
of my dreamland
I wanted you to desire me

I could have
gone with the madness
Gone with the madness

I don't regret you
or that I met you
But I was too honest where games
must take their place
It's such a crime
but I was swept off my feet for
the first time

For the first time
I don't need my pride
To you it was crazy
But I'm still excited inside
But I wanted you
to desire me

I could have
gone with the madness
Gone with the madness

Everything's
gone with the madness
Gone with the madness
