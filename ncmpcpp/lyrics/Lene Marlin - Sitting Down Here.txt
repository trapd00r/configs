I'm sitting down here but hey you can't see me

Your words cut rather deeply
They're just some other lies
I'm hiding from a distance
I've got to pay the price
Defending all against it
I really don't know why
You're obsessed with all my secrets
You always make me cry
You seem to wanna hurt me
No matter what I do
I'm telling just a couple
But somehow it gets to you

But I've learned to get revenge
And I swear you'll experience that someday

I'm sitting down here but hey you can't see me
Kinda invisible you don't sense my stay
Not truly hiding not like a shadow
Just thought I would join you for one day

I'm sitting down here but hey you can't see me

I'm not trying to avoid you
Just don't wanna hear your voice
When you call me up so often
I don't really have a choice
You're talking like you know me
And wanna be my friend
But that's really too late now
I won't try it once again
You may think that I'm a loser
That I don't really care
You may think that it's forgotten
But you should be aware

That I've learned to get revenge
And I swear you'll experience that someday

I'm sitting down here but hey you can't see me
Kinda invisible you don't sense my stay
Not truly hiding not like a shadow
Just thought I would join you for one day

I'm sitting down here but hey you can't see me
Kinda invisible you don't sense my stay
Not truly hiding not like a shadow
But sure I wanna join you for one day

You seem to wanna hurt me
No matter what I do
I'm telling just a couple
But somehow it gets to you

But I've learned to get revenge
And I swear you'll experience that someday

I'm sitting down here but hey you can't see me
Kinda invisible you don't sense my stay
Not truly hiding not like a shadow
Just thought I would join you for one day

I'm sitting down here but hey you can't see me
Kinda invisible you don't sense my stay
Not truly hiding not like a shadow
Just thought I would join you for one day

I'm sitting down here but hey you can't see me
Kinda invisible you don't sense my stay
Not truly hiding not like a shadow
Just thought I would join you for one day.
