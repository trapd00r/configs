Called you on the phone
Said I'm comin' through
Hope your all alone
Cause I got plans for you

We could stay at home
Or dance and hang all night
As long as I'm with you
Doesn't matter what we do

Don't ask me where I've been
Or what I'm gonna do
Just know that I'm here with you
Don't try understand
Baby there's no mystery
Cause you know how I am

[Chorus]
I'm real
What you get is what you see
What you tryin' to do to me
You want to say your mine
Be with me all the time
You're falling so in love
And you just can't get enough
You're tellin' all your friends
She's a bad, bad bitch

You like the way I dress
The way I wear my hair
Show me off to all your friends
And baby I don't care
Just as long as you
Tell them who I am
Tell them I'm the one who made you give a damn

Don't ask me where I've been
Or what I'm gonna do
Just know that I'm here with you
Don't try understand
Baby there's no mystery
Cause you know how I am

[Chorus]
