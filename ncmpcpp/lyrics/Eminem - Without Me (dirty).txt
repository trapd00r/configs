Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside

Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back, guess who's back

I've created a monster
'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
They want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya

A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some Vodka to jump start my heart quicker
Than the shocks when I get shocked at the hospital
When the doctor when I'm not co-operating

When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating

I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be or let me be me
So let me see

They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits

And get ready 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you Debbie

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little Hallions, kids feelin' rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, "Bitch"

A visionary, vision of scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass

And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you can see so damn much of my ass, you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, na na na na na na na na na na
Fix your damn antenna, tune it in and then I'm gonna
Enter in under your skin like a splinter

The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Investing in your kid's ears a nest egg

Testing, attention please
Feel the tension, soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

A-tisket, a-tasket, I go tit for tat with
Anybody who's talkin' this shit, that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than those little Limp Bizkit bastards

And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six year old boy fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno

Now let's go, just gimme the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol

But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene

And though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
Do black music so selfishly
And used it to get myself wealthy

Here's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me, kids
