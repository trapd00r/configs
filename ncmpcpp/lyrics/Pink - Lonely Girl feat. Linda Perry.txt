I can remember
The very first time I cried
How I wiped my eyes
And buried the pain inside 
All of my memories
Good and bad that's passed 
Didn't even take the time to realize

Staring at the cracks in the walls
'Cause I'm waiting for it all
to come to an end
Still I curl up right under the bed 
'Cause it's takin' over my head
All over again

Do you even know who you are?
I guess I'm trying to find
A borrowed dream or a superstar?
I want to be a star
Is life good to you, or is it bad?
I can't tell anymore
Do you even know what you have?

Lying awake
Watching the sunlight
How the birds will sing 
As I count the rings around my eyes
Constantly pushing 
The world I know aside
I don't even feel the pain 
I don't even want to try

I'm looking for a way to become
The person that I dreamt up
When I was 16
Oh, nothing is ever enough
Ooh, baby it ain't enough
For what it may seem 

Do you even know who you are?
I'm still trying to find
A borrowed dream or a superstar?
Everybody wants to be...
Is life good to you, or is it bad?
I can't tell anymore
Do you even know what you have?
No

Sorry girl
Tell a tale for me
'Cause I'm wondering
How you really feel
I'm a lonely girl 
I'll tell a tale for you
'Cause I'm just trying to make
All my dreams come true

Do you even know who you are?
Oh yeah, yeah 
A borrowed dream or a superstar?
Oh, I wanted to be a star
Is life good to you, or is it bad?
I can't tell, I can't tell anymore 
Do you even know what you have?
I guess not, oh, I guess not 

Do you even know who you are? 
Oh, I'm trying to find 
A rising dream, or a falling star? 
Oh, I have all these dreams 
Is life good to you, or is it bad? 
I can't tell anymore 
Do you even know what you have? 
Oh, no, no 

-Fades-
Do you even know who you are? 
A rising dream, or falling star? 
Is life good to you, or is it bad?
