I'm Miss American Dream since I was seventeen
Don't matter if I step on the scene or 
Sneak away to the Philippines
They still gon' put pictures of my derrière in the magazine
You want a piece of me?
You want a piece of me?

I'm Miss Bad Media Karma, another day, another drama
Guess I can't see the harm in working and being a mom
And with a kid on my arm, I'm still an exceptional earner
You want a piece of me?

I'm Mrs. Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous
You want a piece of me?
I'm Mrs. "Oh My God! That Britney's Shameless!"
You want a piece of me?
I'm Mrs. "Extra! Extra! This Just In!"
You want a piece of me?
I'm Mrs. "She's Too Big, Now She's Too Thin"
You want a piece of me?

I'm Mrs. "You Want a Piece of Me?" tryin' and pissin' me off
Well, get in line with the paparazzi, who's flippin' me off
Hoping I'll resort to some havoc, end up settlin' in court
Now are you sure you want a piece of me?
You want a piece of me?

I'm Mrs. Most Likely to Get On the TV for Strippin' On the Streets
When getting the groceries. No, for real. Are you kidding me?
No wonder there's panic in the industry, I mean, please
Do you want a piece of me?

I'm Mrs. Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous
You want a piece of me?
I'm Mrs. "Oh My God! That Britney's Shameless!"
You want a piece of me?
I'm Mrs. "Extra! Extra! This Just In!"
You want a piece of me?
I'm Mrs. "She's Too Big, Now She's Too Thin"
You want a piece of me?

I'm Miss American Dream since I was seventeen
Don't matter if I step on the scene 
Or sneak away to the Philippines
They still gon' put pictures of my derrière in the magazine
You want a piece of me?
You want a piece, piece of me?

You want a piece of me?
