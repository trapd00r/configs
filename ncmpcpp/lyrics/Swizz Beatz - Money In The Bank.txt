It's Showtime!

(Chorus:)
She ain't got no money in the bank
She be walking 'round actin' all stank
And now she at the party looking at me
Hopin' she can get saved by me
I'm lookin at her like (right)
I ain't tryna save that girl (NO SIR!)
I ain't tryna save that girl (NO SIR!)
I ain't tryna save that girl (NO SIR!)
She got her hand up but i tryna pay that girl

(Verse 1)
Now, what ya'll wanna do? (do)
Wanna be ballers, shot callers, brawlers
give me ur numba i beat she gon call ya
Come on dawg she want u to spoil her
Cristian Dior and them new Fendi bags
Anything is good cause it's better than she had
She sitting at the bar and she's lookin' so sad
Something 'bout, uh-uh I wanna ride in your jag
Uh uh uh, I wanna ride to your house
I said "easy chick, I fly to my house"
I, live so far think I live down south
Why don't you pull it out my pants and put it in yo mouth (echoes)

(Chorus:)
She ain't got no money in the bank
She be walking 'round actin' all stank
And now she at the party looking at me
Hopin' she can get saved by me
I'm lookin at her like (right)
I ain't tryna save that girl (NO SIR!)
I ain't tryna save that girl (NO SIR!)
I ain't tryna save that girl (NO SIR!)
She got her hand up but i tryna pay that girl

(Verse 2:)
I see ya, you got ya best shoes on
Good dress on, I mean you got your best on
I'm sitting at the back drankin' viva glico 
The caroselito, you know how we do


before them models came you wasn't f**kin with my niggas
My homies say wassup you saying nothing to my niggas
Come on girlfriend why you fronting for my niggas
They come and that paper is nothing for my niggas
Don't you know we got that money in the (money in the bank) I repeat
Don't you know we got that (money in the bank)
You ain't getting none from me or my bank
Better get you own, g-g-get out my face (face)

(Chorus)
She ain't got no money in the bank
She be walking 'round actin' all stank
And now she at the party looking at me
Hopin' she can get saved by me
I'm lookin at her like (right)
I ain't tryna save that girl (NO SIR!)
I ain't tryna save that girl (NO SIR!)
I ain't tryna save that girl (NO SIR!)
She got her hand up but i tryna pay that girl

(Verse 3:)
It's started like soft and warm
Don't get excited, I've been invited to the quiet storm
Now its out of hand cause she told me she hate me
And then she said "opening up and leave me"
Plus she said all she want is love and affection
Let me be your angel, and I'll be your protection
Took her out bought her all kinds of things
But it wasn't enough, so this is the song I sing
Cause she broke

(Chorus:)
She ain't got no money in the bank
She be walking 'round actin' all stank
And now she at the party looking at me
Hopin' she can get saved by me
I'm lookin at her like (right)
I ain't tryna save that girl (NO SIR!)
I ain't tryna save that girl (NO SIR!)
I ain't tryna save that girl (NO SIR!)
She got her hand up but i tryna pay that girl

lets, let, lets go!
