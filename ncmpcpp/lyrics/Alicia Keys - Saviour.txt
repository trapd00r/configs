Ooh baby now,
I'm tellin ya
When you need me
I'm there for you anytime
Ooh baby now
Just call my name
I'm runnin' to get ya anything
I don't mind
'Cause boy its in my nature
I don't care
'Cause that's just the way i am
I don't mind
'Cause you're so deserving
Loving you with all that i am
Oh!
After i've give my all
You'll be there to catch me if i fall

Who's gonna save me
When I'm empty
I need a someone
To fill me
Will you be my saviour
Rescue me
'Cause when I'm out saving you
Baby who's saving me?

Baby I'm
A special kind
Call at the last minute
I'll be on time
I'll take an inch
And make a mile
Don't worry

I'll hold you down
I don't mind
'Cause boy its my pleasure
I don't care
'Cause that's just the way i am

I don't mind
'Cause baby you're my treasure
Loving you with all that i am
Oh!
If I'm all down and hung out to dry
If there's nothing left
No more inside

Will you still save me
When I'm empty
I need a someone
To fill me
Will you be my saviour
Rescue me
'Cause when I'm out saving you
Baby who's saving me?

I'm my number one priority
Ain't nobody takin' better care of me than me
Loving hard
Is my tendency
And I'm hoping that
You are the one who is willing to

Just save me
When I'm empty
I need a someone
To fill me
Will you be my saviour
Rescue me
'Cause when I'm out saving you
Baby who's saving me?

Will you be my saviour?

Baby who's saving me?
