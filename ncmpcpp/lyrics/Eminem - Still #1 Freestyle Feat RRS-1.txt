Nigga we are, so ready for the war
C-A-R-T-E-R, put the beat in ER
I’m colder than BR, add another three Rs
Watch me like D-V-D V-C-R
Pump to your chest, I ain’t talking CPR
Ridin this track like a motha fuckin street car
New Orleans coroner, his name is Slick Mem ya’ll
Fuck with me wrong you’ll be wakin up in his yard
Man I go crazy on the beat, I go nimrod
Man I act a ass treat the beat like a hemorrhoid 
Man I go to work on the beat, call it employ
Man I kicks it, bitch get your shinguards
Young Money run this, towns, countries
I still eat rappers, Mmmmm, scrumptious
My goons toe thumpers, they pump em like Krumpers
Anybody beat, I’ll dunk on Archie Bunkers
Touchie Be the widest, that run the Metro-polis
I pop like Lollis, you drop like eyelids
The money keep callin, I hear the shit dialin
And they say money talks, you can hear my shit hollerin
You softer than Nylen, oops I meant nylon
Perfection is the goal and I’m headed to the pylon
Crown feelin good, I ain’t even gotta try on
The pistol mean business, that bitch should have a tie on
Teeta told me do this shit, so I had to do this shit
I get super hero money, call that nigga super rich
Keep it super far and wide, let me get on my super shit
Super ill, super sick, dawg I go super Vick
Ran into a super woman, turned her to a super bitch
Hit her with that super dick, she be comin super quick
Super Millz, Mack, Tyga, Streets, Nell and super Nick
Super Drizzy, Gudda, Chuckie, Twiss that’s the super clique
Now I’m off that super shit, fuck that shit I super quit
Runnin’ circles round the game, like a hula-hoop and shit
You gon’ have to nuke that shit, that won’t be a duplicate
And my blunts be super thick, I’m higher than a super kick
I’m-I’m the bomb baby, watch me nuke this shit
When I leave the booth, they gotta scoop the shit
My apologies, diabolically
I’m the prodigy, do you roger me?
I look in the flames, and see the hot of me
But how come I’m still, colder than commonly?
Yea we run this town like a lot of feet
Young Mula baby, I’m proud of me
