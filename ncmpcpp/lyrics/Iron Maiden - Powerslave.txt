Into the Abyss I'll fall- the eye of Horus
Into the eyes of the night- watching me go
Green is the cat's eye that glows- in this Temple
Enter the risen Osiris-risen again.

Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a God,
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies,
All around is laid  waste.
And in my last hour,
I'm a slave to the Power of Death.

When I was living this lie-Fear was my game
People would worship and fall-
Drop to their knees.
So bring me the blood and red wine
For the one to succeed me,
for he is a man and a God-
And He will die too.

Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a God,
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies,
All around is laid to waste.
And in my last hour,
I'm a slave to the Power of Death.

Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins,
Silent the terror that reigned-
Marbled in stone.
A shell of a man God preserved-
For a thousand ages,
But open the gates of my Hell-
I will strike from my grave.

Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a God,
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies,
All around is laid waste.
And in my last hour,
I'm a slave to the Power of Death,
Slave to the Power of Death...
Slave to the Power of Death...
