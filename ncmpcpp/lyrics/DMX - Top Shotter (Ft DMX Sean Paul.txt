Rrrrrgh, uh, uh-huh
Uh.. uhh uhh, uh-huh
Here comes the boom (8X)

Here comes the boom!  Boomin, bouncin
Stalkin, must walk in, hawk get to pouncin
Get em where it counts and, hit em like a mountain
Spit em have em spittin out, blood like a fountain
Don't look at me like that, we just might fight black
And that fight, might end up in me takin your life back
I don't, go for the bullshit, cause I've been down
and time is, just too important to be fuckin around
Talk nigga, I stomp a mudhole in your face
Motherfucker, rip your butthole out of place
Cock the glock to your head, let off about two in it
Yeah it's a dirty job, but I just love doin in

Here comes the boom (8X)
