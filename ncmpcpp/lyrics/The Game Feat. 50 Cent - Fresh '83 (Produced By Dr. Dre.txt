[50] Sh-sh-sh-SHA-DY! Aftermath
[Em] Ha ha, G-G-G-G, G-Unit!
[50] Ha ha! (Ha ha)

[Chorus: 50 + Eminem]
Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce toniiiiiight
And if they don't let us in through the front do'
Come through the siiiiiide
Cause I don't wanna ever leave the game without
at least saying goodbyyyyyye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
scream one last tiiiiiime

[Eminem]
Get your ass up for the Doctor, one more time
Get your ass up for the Doctor, c'mon now!
Here we go, cliffhanger, it's another club banger
Got you hangin on the edge of your seat, get on down

[Dr. Dre]
Time's up, game's over, you lose, I win
Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase begin
Look who's got you goin crazy again 
I'ma trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means you somethin that we already had
But once you're gone you don't come back

[Eminem]
Too bad, you're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin and moanin, whinin and bitchin
Sit and observe, listen you'll learn if you pay attention
Why I send multi-platinum albums, later three diamond
Worldwide, we on the charts with a bullet, and still climbin

[Chorus]

[Em] When Dr. Dre says crunk, you will get it crunk!
[Dr] Get it crunk (CRUNK, CRUNK, CRUNK)
[Em] And when 50 Cent says jump, you get on one foot and
[50] Jump (JUMP, JUMP, JUMP)

[Dr. Dre]
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you artists censored
I don't gotta promote it, for you to know that Doc is off the benches

[Eminem]
We keep the party rockin off the hinges
We ain't showin off, we're just goin off, popular contentions

[Dr. Dre]
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk, Doc is all
washed up, knock it off, who the fuck is Doc impressin?
Doctor's this, Doctor's that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, cause Doc left you all guessin
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record {*crackle*} WHAT?
We gon' have this motherfucker hoppin in a second (PUMP PUMP)
That's why we always save the best cut last
to make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass

[Eminem]
Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers whom if it
wasn't for rap to bridge the gap maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Graced the cover of Rolling Stone pages, broke down barriers
of language and races, just call on the caped crusaders
and leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic and we can play the
back and forth all day like the hot potato game that's why we came to

[Chorus]

[Eminem] 50 Cent, c'mon!

[50 Cent]
Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump, everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved

[Dr. Dre]
And plenty honies involved, the sunny Sundays and palm trees
Cali, every day is just another party from the valleys
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally

[Eminem]
Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre's about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week

[Dr. Dre]
You can catch me in the studio, bangin out the beats to
provide you with the heat that keep blazin out your speaker

[Eminem]
So never say never cause Shady/Aftermath together
along with G-Unit Records, presents the return of
The, The Doc (and Shady) no one can do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a shred of evidence that uh

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Yeah! Ha ha
Still Aftermath, 2006
And don't worry bout that "Detox" album, it's comin
We gon' make Dre do it (ha ha)
50 Cent, G-Unit
Obie Trice, D-Twizy, Stat Quo, Dr. Dre, we ain't leavin
Let's go! Ha ha
Ladies and gentlemen
Thank you all for comin out
PEACE!

{*crowd cheers to fade and chants "Em-i-nem*}

[Eminem] Oh shit, I almost forgot, you're comin with me!
{*gunshots*}
[Eminem] {*laughing*}
{*scream*}
[Eminem] {*laughing*} Bye bye!
