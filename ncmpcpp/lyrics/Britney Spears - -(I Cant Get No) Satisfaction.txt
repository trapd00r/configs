Send "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" Ringtone to your Cell I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
And I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no satisfaction 

When I'm drivin' in my car
And that man comes on the radio
And he's tellin' me more and more
About some useless information

Supposed to fire my imagination
I can't get no, oh no no no
Hey hey hey, this what I say

[Chorus]
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no reaction
And I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no satisfaction

When I'm watchin' my TV
and that girl comes on to tell me
how tight my skirts should be
well she can't tell me who to be

'Cause I've got my own identity.
I can't get no, oh no no no

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction

[Chorus]

I can't get no, satisfaction
I can't get no, satisfaction

I can't get no satisfaction baby
