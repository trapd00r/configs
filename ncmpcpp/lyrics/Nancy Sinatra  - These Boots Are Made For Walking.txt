You keep saying you've got something for me
Something you call love, but confess
You've been a messin' where you shouldn'ta been a-messin'
And now someone else is gettin' all your best

These boots are made for walkin'
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you
Yeah

You keep lying when you oughta be truthin'
And you keep losin' when you oughta not bet
You keep samin' when you oughta be a-changin'
Now what's right is right, but you ain't been right yet

These boots are made for walkin'
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

You keep playin' where you shouldn't be playin'
And you keep thinkin' that you'll never get burned, ha
I just found me a brand new box of matches, yeah
And what he knows you ain't had time to learn

These boots are made for walkin'
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

Are you ready boots?
Start walkin'!
