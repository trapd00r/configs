You never ask things you wonder
You just wait until you wonder no more
You're giving up so gently to get what your dreams are keeping you awake for
Who hears your heart talking only ears that can do you no harm
You only hear it if they listen
You've changed your love you've changed your life you've changed your ways and that has taken you far taken you far
Your eyes are constantly broken but your hands overwhelm a thousandfold
So when are the things you're touching gonna be someone you can hold
No need for love and you need no one
You let them come so you can make them go
It must be something you believe in somewhere your way is leading to is leading to
