He got me with a hook 
Those big bass notes 
Thunder in my chest 
mmm, stuck in my throat 
Pulling me down 
Like a rumble in the ground 
Crawls up from the depths 
With a deep down sound 

(CHORUS) 
Johnny got a boom boom 
Johnny got a bamm 
He got a... 

Big bomb body 
Lonely neck 
Swear he was a women 
That he hadn't his grip 
Big vibrations yeah 
Just one glance 
He gonna blow my mind 
He's gonna make me wanna 
Make me wanna ohh 

(CHORUS) 

Watch that man 
See whats in his hands 
Got no joy 
He's a big bad boy 

He's gonna freak you out 
Your gonna shriek out loud 
He's got ya in his hands 
He's gonna make ya wanna 
Make ya wanna ohhh 

(CHORUS) 

Watch that man 
See whats in his hands 
Got no joy 
He's a big bad boy 

He's gonna freak you out 
Your gonna shriek out loud 
He's got ya in his hands 
Gonna make ya wanna 
Make ya wanna ohh 

Johnny got a boom boom oh yeah 
Johnny got a bamm 
I said that johnny got a boom boom 
Ohh yeah johnny got a 
He got a, he got a, he got a
