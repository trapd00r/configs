Shawty said, "Take it off"
I take it off
Climb right out of my clothes
Want me to break you off?
I break you off
'Til your love come down on them walls

I'm extremely focused when I'm strokin'
I bet I'll get you open
I'll leave your headboard broken
You think I'm jokin'?
I bet I'll get you open

First it's her neck, yeah, then her back
Yeah, I'm a freak, I get into all that
Girl I perform for you, like a porno star
'Til you had enough then I just need a lil' bit more

New music, new move, new position
New erotic sounds is goin' down, now listen
I can hear your heartbeat, your sweatin'
I can paint a perfect picture
I get deeper and deeper
I told you I'd get you

I'll work that, murk that, just the way you like it baby
Turn a quickie into an all-nighter, maybe
Your sex drive, it match my sex drive
Then we be movin' as fast as a NASCAR ride

Switch gears, slow down, go down, whoa now
You can feel every inch of it when we intimate
I use my tounge baby, I'll leave you sprung baby
I'll have your head spinnin' sayin, "50 so crazy"

Baby, you can start on top, or all fours
You know I like it, when you get into it
Don't nobody do it, uh, like I do it

Feel the rush, from my touch, get intoxicated
Drunk off my love, call it Hennessy thug
Passion, you laughin', I make you smile on a regular
Tell me what you want shawty, that's what I'mma get for you

I need you to give what I need, more than liquor and weed
I need you to maybe give me a seed
I need you to give me reason to breath
I need you, I'm tellin' you so now you know what I need

I be your part-time or full-time lover, significant-other
No matter which way it go, I'm oh so gutter
Girl, you can get it however you want to get it
