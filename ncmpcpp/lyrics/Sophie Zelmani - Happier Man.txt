It has never been this quiet
And we have never seen a storm
Though you really made things quiet
I think I will stay calm

'Cause I can't move the slightest finger
Let alone raise my hand
I'm sure we lived like lovers
But you dreamt of becoming a happier man

And I can't tell what I had chosen
If no choices of this kind can be made
I was happy for a long time
But that's not what I feel today

It has never been this dreamlike
And we have never seen a ghost
Though you are bringing me a nightmare
It's not what frightens me the most

You make me go through my visions
And what it was that we achieved
You make me ransack love for it's goodness
And if love ever leads to harmony
If love ever leads to harmony
