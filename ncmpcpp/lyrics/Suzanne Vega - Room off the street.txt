Somewhere in a room
With a poster on a wall
Of a man with his hand
In a fist


Is a woman who's drinking
And her dress is so tight
You can see every breath
That she takes


Every sigh, every sway
You can hear everything that they say
Something's begun like a war
Or a family or a friendship
Or a fast love affair


The man on the wall
Is his symbol of freedom
It means he has brothers
Who believe as he does


She is moved by
The thing that she sees in his face
Whe he talks of
The cause


Every sigh, every sway
You can hear everything that they say
Something's begun like a war
Or a family or a friendship
Or a fast love affair


She leans against him
Her dress is so red
They talk of the salt
And the truth and the bread


The night goes along
The fan goes around
In the room off the street
At the end of the town


Every sigh, every sway
You can hear everything that they say
Something's begun like a war
Or a family or a friendship
Or a fast love affair
