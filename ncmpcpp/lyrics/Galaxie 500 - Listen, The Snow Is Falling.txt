Listen the snow is falling over town
Listen the snow is falling everywhere
Between Empire State Building
And between Trafalgar Square
Listen the snow is falling over town

Listen the snow is falling over town
Listen the snow is falling everywhere
Between your bed and mine
Between your head and my mind
Listen the snow is falling over town

Between Tokyo and Paris
Between London and Dallas
Between your God and mine
Listen the snow is falling everywhere

Snow dream
Snow fall
Snow fly
Listen
Listen
