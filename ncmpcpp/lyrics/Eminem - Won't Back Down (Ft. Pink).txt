P!nk:
You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard
You can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no

Eminem:
Cadillac Sevilles Coup Devilles, brain dead rims yeah stupid wheels
Girl I'm too for real lose your tooth and nail, try to fight it try to deny it stupid you will feel
What I do I do at will, shootin' from the hip, yeah boy, shoot to kill
Half a breath left, on my death bed screamin' F that, yeah super ill

Baby what the deal, we can chill, split a half a pill and a happy meal
Fuck a steak slut, I'll cut my toes off and step on the receipt 'fore I foot the bill
Listen garden tool, don't make me introduce you to my power tool, you know the fuckin' drill
How you douchebags feel, knowin' you're disposable, Summer's Eve, Massengil

Shady's got that mass appeal, baby crank this shit 'cause it's your God damn jam
You say that you want your punch lines a little more compact, well shorty I'm that man
These other cats ain't metaphorically where I'm at, man
I gave Bruce Wayne a valium and said settle your fuckin' ass down, I'm ready for combat, man

Get it, calm batman, naw, ain't nobody whose as bomb and as
Nuts, lines are like mom's cat scans 'cause they fuckin' go bananas
Honey, I applaud that ass, swear to God man, these broads can't dance
Ma, show em how it's done, spaz like a God damn Taz, yeah

P!nk:
You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard

But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no

Eminem:
Girl shake that ass like a donkey with Parkinson's
Make like Michael J. Fox is in your drawers playin' with an etch-a-sketch
Bet ya that you'll never guess whose knockin' at your doors
People hit the floors, yeah tonight ladies you gon get divorced

Girl forget remorse, I'ma hit you broads with Chris' force like you pissed him off
Talented with the tongue, mo'fucker you ain't got a lick in yours
Hittin' licks like I'm robbin' liquor stores, makin' cash registers shit their drawers
Think you spit the rawest, I'm an uncooked slab of beef layin' on your kitchen floor

Other words, I'm off the meat rack, bring the beat back, bring me two extension cords
I'ma measure my dick, shit I need six inches more, fuck, my dick's big
Bitch, need I remind you that I don't need the fuckin' swine flu to be a sick pig
You're addicted, I'm dope, I'm the longest needle around here, need a fix up

I'm the big shot, get it, dick snots, you're just small pokes, little pricks (ha)
Girl you think that other pricks hot, I'll drink gasoline and eat a lit match
'Fore I sit back and let him get hotter, better call the cops on him, quick-fast
Shady's right back on your bitch-ass, white trash with a half a six-pack
In his hatch back trailer hitch attached to the back (dispatch)

Eminem:
Bitch, am I the reason that your boyfriend stopped rappin', does a bird chirp,flu
Does Lil Wayne slurp syrup till he burps and smoke purp, does a word search
Gettin' circles wrapped around it like you do when I come through, I'd like you to
Remind yourself of what the fuck I can do when I'm on the mic, girl, you're the kind of girl that I can take a likin' to

Psych, I'm spikin' you like a football, been this way since I stood a foot tall
You're a good catch with a shitty spouse, got a pretty mouth and a good jaw
Give me good brain, watch the wood grain, don't want no cum stain, bitch you listening
Tryin' to turn me down, slut I'm talkin' to you, turn me back up, are you insane

Tryin' to talk over me in the car, shut the fuck up while my shit's playing
I'm a shit stain on the underwear of life, what's the saying, where there's thunder, there's lightning
And they say that it never stikes twice in the same place
Then how the fuck have I been hit six times in three different locations on four separate occasions

And you can bet your stinkin' ass that I've come to smash everything in my path
Fork was in the road, took the psycho path, poison ivy wouldn't have me thinkin' rash
So hit the dance floor, cutie, while I do my duty on this microphone, shake your booty
Shorty I'm the shit, why you think Proof used to call me Doody

P!nk:
