[Intro]
 Aw man, yea
 You ever be in the club man, you get in a fight
 And people that you don't even know jump in?

  [Verse 1]
 You feel like you wanna hit something, your fist clenches, your pissed
 You just wanna get someone with shit, jump on this
 You're bout to get your shit pushed in, I'm just inches away 
I'm splitting your shit wide open, no stitches could save
 So die with your eyes open, you hope this isn't the way 
You end up going out, but I guess it just is I'm afraid
 Razors, scissors and blades make Jason say isn't this great
 On-lookers participate in this ass-kicking debate
 They're starting to take place in the middle of the street
 Little did you know there'd be an all-out brawl soon as you heard this beat 
Emergency personnel rush to the murder scene, but its too late It's absolute pandemonium, whisked away
 In a ambulance is your fate, nothing nobody told you when you- Left your house today coulda made you anticipate 
Such an ass whooping, okay, til the anger dissipates 
You get punched in the face, reciprocate  

[Chorus x2] So what the deal, ridaz? 
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
 My balls are feeling a-mighty big now 
I might just have to dig down and pull em through my britches
 I said...

  [Verse 2]
 You step in the place with enough misplaced anger to catch a case
 Anxious to get in some shit, got your gangstas all with your ladies
 You better go get your mace cuz shady said so You may wanna pick up the radio and bang it against your face 
That's how fucking rowdy you feel, now do you still wanna grill?
 If you don't wanna get the shit beat outta you, chill
 Cuz if you doubt me you will, yea got me a pill, found me a thrill
 I got a couple of drinks here and I'm bound to refill 
Girl howdy, how do you feel ma?
 This cocksucker did not spill my drink, Oh HELL no He must be tryna kill my buzz, I will not budge
 And what the deal ridaz?
 Now here they all come and they got your back in like 2 seconds flat 
That's probably a record yea, you wasn't expecting that 
Cuz they want in on the act, there's a cognac- Bottle, we snuck it in cuz the beer that they were serving here was only tap
 I'm biting, I fight dirty, you might get kicked in the nuts 
You're frightened like this guy might hurt me You're quite certain he's nuts, I've hit myself in the face harder 
Play smarter, you may start a rumble you need a chainsaw to 
Dig your way out of, go powder your nose- Pussy the harder you yell, the harder I slap the shit out of you hoes
You set it off faggot, so now how do you spose- We settle it, hit me in the nose, we'll see how it goes  

[Chorus x2]  

It's shear hustle, I bob, weave, deflate your beer muscles
 We're tussling, the crowd's starting to cheer us
 And adrenaline's rushing through us just like a geyser gushing 
Too much Budweiser in my blood, I'm strangling your windpipe for nothing, my signatures, ligature marks
Look at you all big with your remarks, and I swing an icepick at your heart
 At least that's what it feels like when I pick you apart
And dig at you and break you down like the bitch that you are
 The predicament starts when I throw a brick at your car
 The pain inflicted upon you, it's so sick, it's bizarre 
Shit, this is almost ridiculous, addictive as far
As having me wanna rip out your frickin ligaments ARGH!
 You hit like a bitch, you scratch me with your nails, for that- You catch an open-hand slap, like a female, like BAP!
In fact, I'll have the crowd smacking you themselves Where's D12, I don't feel like doing this by myself

  [Chorus x2]
