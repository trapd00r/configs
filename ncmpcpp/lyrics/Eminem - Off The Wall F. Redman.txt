 Yo
 (Yo)
 Look!
 (Yo)
 
 [Eminem]
 No matter what people say
 I'm gon' keep rapping this way
 No matter what you may think
 I'm gon' keep doing my thing
 
 One of the worst things
 Is fat, bald men decided to write songs
 And teach Mouseketeers to sing
 I'll stick Britney Spears in a room full of mirrors
 So she gets fifty years of bad luck
 Club and swear at Christina Aguilera
 When I grab her by the hair and drag her across the Sahara
 (Bitch!)
 You aware of this rap terrorist with a therapist
 With a hair up his ass like a rabbit crawled up his pants
 Got a habit of holding Tylenol in his hands
 Till it melts in his fucking palms and dissolves in his glands
 (So who is it?)
 The fool who visits the playground
 With two biscuits to lay down the school district
 Get pissed with a whip with a Marseburg
 With a pistol grip and fed pit bull shit
 Sniff glue sticks like I give two shits
 If I get too rich I just get sued
 
 [Redman]
 Yo I leave with no engine
 After I blow four in ya
 One handstand on top of your ninja
 Crashin' Doc stir the madness
 We all out of work like Tony Atlas
 Walking with cans in a laundry basket
 America's most with the army after us
 Fuck flossin' we take what's yours
 Unload fifteen like an ace and four
 I'm out of work but Doc laid them off
 (Shit! The power's out)
 The tape is off
 Yo who target it from arsonists?
 Paper make pens filled with arsenic
 I got hoes that don't know what Prada is
 Doc can shave up, cut your barber miss
 ?
 I turn out camps in to crystal lakes
 And fuck bitches face is what I'mma do
 Cause that's what white boy Tyno do
 
 [Eminem]
 So how's everybody doing tonight?
 Hope you in the mood to get drunk
 To screw and to fight
 Cause uh we getting down for the fuck of it
 So suck my dick if y'all don't wanna bump to this
     
 [Redman]
 So how's everybody feeling tonight?
 Hope you in the mood to get rude
 And illin' to fight
 Cause uh we getting down for the fuck of it
 So suck my dick if you don't wanna bump

 [Redman]
 Yo when my gat spit it hospital son admitted
 Rip your lips off kiss my ass with it
 Slap bitches, Doc, Marshall Maths..
 (Print it!)
 We ex and ass of tabs did it
 I'm what's happening with no rerun
 Doc rob Dinero when the heat come
 My barrel hangs out the Camero
 Aimed at the nose when them hoes is hard to breathe from
 Flash the gat your town bow guarded
 Your wallet, your chain the main target
 Beef is like cold engine, don't start it
 Bust in the air and hit an airplane pilot
 We pound you, rap surround sounds around you
 From ten speed and brown shoe
 Doc and Eminem, cock the M&M
 Blood flows with 2Paclypse and them
 It's like Funk Doctor
 
 [Eminem]
 Mr. Punk Rocker
 Got the drug stock inside the lunch box
 Pop junk like I just got jumped
 Pop the trunk and pull out the shotgun pump
 Knock wood, it's all good
 Thank God for vodka
 But with my luck, I'll probably get shot by a stalker
 Probably got a Fanatic waiting upstairs in the attic
 With an automatic calling me up there
 My man Stan with a gat in his hand
 Staking my house out in a damn tinted Sedan
 Pull your mouth out till you can't finish a damn
 Ham sandwich or your canned spinach or Spam
 You gotta sip through a straw
 Shop lift through the mall
 Pictures of me on my mom's living room wall
 Hey ma maybe I'll give you a call
 SIKE! YOU FUCKING BITCH!
 Suck a dick and two balls
 I'm giving you all my shocking script 
 Which is to piss a priest off with this
 Pop more pills than police officers
 Arrive at the scene to pull me off of Kim
 Teeth off my dick, hands off my balls
 But y'all can kiss my ass, pants off and all
 Cause I'm so goddamn off the wall
 I might as well be a painting smashed on the floor
 
 [Redman]
