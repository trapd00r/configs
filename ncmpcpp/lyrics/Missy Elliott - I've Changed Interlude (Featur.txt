Send "(Another Song) All Over Again" Ringtone to your Cell You've been alone 
You've been afraid 
I've been a fool 
In so many ways 
But I would change my life 
If you thought you might try to love me 

So please give me another chance 
To write you another song 
Take back those things I've done 
'Cause I'll give you my heart 
If you would let me start all over again 

I'm not a saint 
I'm just a man 
Who had heaven and earth in the palm of his hand 
But I threw it away 
So now I stand here today asking forgiveness 
And if you could just

Please, give me another chance 
To write you another song 
Take back those things I've done 
'Cause I'll give you my heart 
If you would let me start all over again 

Little girl, you're all I've got 
Don't you leave me standing here once again 
'Cause I'll give you my life (yes I would) 
If you would let me try to love you 

So please give me another chance
To write you another song
And take back those things I've done
'Cause I'll give you my heart
If you would let me start all over again
Again, oh
No no
Oh oh

You know I love you (yeah)
Give me one more chance
No no
No no no no
