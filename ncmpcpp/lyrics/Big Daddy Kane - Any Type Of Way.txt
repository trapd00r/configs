Uh Yeah
Ayo Prim' man
I be hollering at these cats man, you know
Trying to make them understand the realness in this here game man you know
This how serious it is on these streets
Yo check it, uh...

(1st verse)
Survival of the Fittest today, that's still the test
I seen em kill the best, in this ghetto wilderness
It's real in the field, cause they bring the drama hard
Guliani got me off, looking like it's Amistad
Be whatever's clever, with the thought of slipping
Thug's start to flipping, black women resort to stripping
When they say, the drug game's dead, that's not a fable
Hustler's is locked down, or either got a label
Either try to keep the heat on ya, on the street corner
Ya sleep, a week later, your peeps mourn ya
Stick up kids, pudding in working in pea's
Your food stamps feed the next cat Turkey and Cheese
Aint no devourance, I speak it now in defense
I'm only here to make dollar, outta knowledge, power, sense
So be about the paper, till your pockets are full
Please stop with the bull, less is profitable, come on...

(Chorus: scratched by DJ Premier)
"Making moves any type of way"
"Straight gutter from the ghetto to the burb"
"Take it back to the days of..."
"Do or Die"
"Straight from Bedstuy"
"Know what I'm sayin"

"Making moves any type of way"
"Straight gutter from the ghetto to the burb"
"Put these rapper's under pressure, till they break"
"Ya'll know who this is"
"You know"

(2nd verse)
If you in this for the cheddar, you better get it fast
Cause in another minute, aint gon be no middle class
What you think this shit will last, time to Monopolize
Streets got lots of guys, and I know we got the size
What I prophesize, is the way to start the rise
Cross the T's, dot the I's, and we will not demise
I come through the door, four four's to get at your's
The Eye of the Tiger, no, I'm coming with the claws
It's my chance to get the finance, so why dance
With proper guidance, To take it to the next high stance
I'm tryin to live Incredible, get dat revenue
Thinking ahead of you, that's your girl, let her through
What you better do, is try to chase the paper
Society will rape ya, when you fight forces of nature
I been walked that path before, so I do feel you
The early bird will get the worm, and drink it with Tequila
Ya heard...

(Chorus)

(3rd verse)
I've been sitting outside, building with this O.G.
Never will I forget hte jewels, that he told me
He said when you holding, never show your wins
In this ghetto, your friends flip on you like Doberman's
Dat buldge in your pocket I see, you better hide
While you at it, tuck that medallion inside
Forget the microphone, you need the iron we squeeze
So you can, clap four like Siamese seals
Distrust and greed, this was indeed
Given by the man's, and know we living by the land
And life I tackle, with my soul trapped inside this Tabernackle
The only thing that's missing is the shackle's
Do what we gotta, to enterprise with the dollar
Create a different aura, for the children of tommorow
Therefore Rakim's style, to make my cash
Come to me in big piles, and I'm out like 6 files
Ya heard...

(Chorus)
