Now I can tell you,
About success, about fame.
About the rise and the fall of all the stars in the sky.
Don't it make you smile?
That it will be,
Just let it be, bee.
Won't you let it be?

Now I can tell you,
About the place I belong.
You know it won't last long,
And all those lights they will turn down.
That it will be,
Oh, let it be,
Just let it be, bee.
Won't you let it be?

Now I can see things,
For what they really are.
I guess I'm not that far.
I'm at the point of no return,
Just watch me burn!

That it will be,
Just let it be,
Oh, let it be,
Then, it will be (Just let it be),
Just let it be (That it will be),
Oh let it be (Won't you let it be?),
Let it be (Won't you let it be...?).

Now I can tell you,
The place that I belong.
It won't last long,
The lights, they will turn down.

Oh, let it be,
Oh, let it be,
Oh, let it be (Won't you let it be?),
Oh, let it be (You've got to let it be),
Just let it be (Anyone can see),
Won't you let it be (That it will be)?

Just watch me go.
Oh, let it be,
Just let it be
Won't you let it be?
Won't you let it be (Just let it be)?
Oh, let it be (Let it be),
Just let it be (Won't you let it be?),
Won't you let it be (Won't you let it be?)?
Won't you let it be?

Now I can tell you,
Tell you, tell you, tell you, tell you,
About success, about fame,
About fame, about fame, About fame, About fame.

Won't you let it be?
Oh, let it be,
Just let it be,
Won't you let it be?
