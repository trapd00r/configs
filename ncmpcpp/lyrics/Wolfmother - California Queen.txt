Slipped off into the slip stream
She's looking for the summer dream
Came down from the mountain
To find another machine

Running down all the by-ways
Listen to all that she says
Couldn't see very far
Find out all that you are

My California Queen

Fully air reconditioned
Self-made man machine
With a home made hydroponic
Wait to find out what it means

My California Queen

Standing in front of the rainbow
Could you tell me where do all the people go?
Rising from the mystic haze
Standing in front of all creation

With all their mystic ways
They seem to control the days
Somebody got to get behind it
To find out all that it means

My California Queen
Oh tell me what it means
My California Queen

Standing in front of the rainbow
Could you tell me where do all the people go?
Rising from the mystic haze
Standing in front of all creation
