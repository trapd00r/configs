And you huh? 
You do huh?

We let it in 
We give it out 
And in the end 
What's it all about? 
It must be love

I give you my 
I give you my 
You give me your 
You give me your joy

We used to say 
"Ah Hell, we're young" 
But now we see that life is sad 
And so is love

Ooh baby live your life for love 
Ooh baby live your life for love

We used to say 
"Ah Hell, we're young" 
But now we see that life is sad 
And so is love

Ooh baby for the sake of love 
Ooh baby for the sake of love

And whatever happens 
What really matters? 
It's all we've got 
Isn't that enough?

Life is sad and so is love

You let it slip 
You let it slip 
I love you more 
I love you more for it

Life is sad and so is love

All for love 
Just for the sake of love 
You set me free 
I set you free
