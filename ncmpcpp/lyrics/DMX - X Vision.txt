Too many fingers, too many thumbs
Something wicked this way comes
The best time I've ever had
Waiting around for something bad
Fearless, fearless, ohh
And I know that's why you love me
Fearless, fearless, come on
And I know that's why you love me, chica
And I know that's why you love me, chica
And I know that's why you love me, chica

Oh, so fearless
Oh, so fearless
Oh

This is what it's all about
Take me in and eat me out
Pins and needles in my arms
Oh yes, your lucky charms

Fearless, fearless, ohh
And I know that's why you love me
Fearless, fearless, come on
And I know that's why you love me, chica
And I know that's why you love me, chica
And I know that's why you love me, chica

Oh, so fearless
Oh, so fearless
Oh, so fearless
Oh, so fearless
Oh, yeah
