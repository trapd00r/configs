Man I'm in trouble, 'cause I can't see clear. 
My head is pounding harder and you're not here, are never here. 
But I had it once, but not anymore. 
Well now I am tired and now I am bored, well I'm so bored. 

But I could never leave you, even though I've tried. 
No I could never leave you, 'cause you are mine for life. 

I've been lost I've been found, I've been fooling around. 
I've been hold, I've been told, I've been changing my mind. 
I've been up, I've been down, come on in, take your time. 
I've been low, I've been high, I'm in love with this lie. 
Aooooooo. Do you feel the same? 
Aooooooo. It wears me out again. 

If this is called living, well don't count me in. 
Sure I feel alive, but it doesn't mean a thing, no nothing. 

But I could never leave you, even though I've tried.
