I've got some big news
The bank finally came through
And I'm holdin the keys to a brand new Chevrolet
Have you been outside, it sure is a nice night
How about a little test drive
Down by the lake?

There's a place I know about where the dirt road runs out
And we can try out the four-wheel drive
Come on now what do you say
Girl, I can hardly wait to get a little mud on the tires.

Chorus:
'Cause it's a good night
To be out there soakin' up the moonlight
Stake out a little piece of shore line
I've got the perfect place in mind.
It's in the middle of nowhere only one way to get there
You got to get a little mud on the tires.

--- Instrumental ---

Moonlight on a duck blind
Catfish on a trot line
Sun sets about nine this time of year
We can throw a blanket down
Crickets singin' in the background
And more stars that you can count on a night this clear.

I tell you what we need to do
Is grab a sleepin' bag or two
And build us a little campfire
And then with a little luck we might just get stuck
Let's get a little mud on the tires.

Chorus:
'Cause it's a good night
To be out there soakin' up the moonlight
Stake out a little piece of shore line
I've got the perfect place in mind.
It's in the middle of nowhere only one way to get there
You got to get a little mud on the tires.

And then with a little luck we might just get stuck
Let's get a little mud on the tires...
