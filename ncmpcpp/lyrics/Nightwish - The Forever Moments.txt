The ticktock of time allows me to see
An owl turn to an echo
The butterfly to a cocoon
A swan to ugly duckling
A lake to an ocean

The dead times awake
As I've been called myself to yesterday
The flower has fallen its petals
Out of the petals a cradle I will

My cradle rocks with the waves of time
The time of beauty will never be the same
Oh, little girl, as thou must now leave
Please take me, take me with thee

Now I hear my mother from the deep
Sing me a lullaby of eternal sleep
Wilt blow wee plant that last to recall
As in silence we sing to reborn
