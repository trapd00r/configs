No attorneys
To plead my case
No orbits
To send me into outta space
And my fingers
Are bejeweled
With diamonds and gold
But that ain't gonna help me now

[Chorus]
I'm trouble
Yeah trouble now
I'm trouble y'all
I disturb my town
I'm trouble
Yeah trouble now
I'm trouble y'all
I got trouble in my town

You think your right
But you were wrong
You tried to take me
But I knew all along
You can take me
For a ride
I'm not a fool out
So you better run and hide

[Chorus]

If you see me coming
Down the street then
You know it's time to
Go (and you know it's time to go
cause here comes trouble)

No attorneys
To plead my case
No orbits
To send me into outta space
And my fingers
Are bejeweled
With diamonds and gold
But that ain't gonna help me now

You think your right
But you were wrong
You tried to take me
But I knew all along
You can take me
For a ride
Cause I'm not a fool out
So you better run and hide

[Chorus]

So if you see me coming
Down the street then
You know it's time to
Go (go-oh-oh, I got)

[Chorus]

Trouble
Yeah trouble now
I'm trouble ya'll
I got trouble in my town
I'm trouble
Yeah trouble now
I'm trouble ya'll
I got trouble in my town [Repeat: x3]
