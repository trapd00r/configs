I know in my mind 
We weren't meant to be 
Are you feeling me yo? 
I'm the girl in your life 
I'm the one you call wife 
And I need to know 
Are you feeling me yo? 
Is there anyone else? 
That can do it the best 
Give you things you need 
Well it must be me 
I've got very good dreams 
And the fantasies 
But I need to know 
Are you feeling me yo?

Boy, are you feeling me?

Something in my heart 
Tells me you're the one 
Boy, are you feeling me? 
Cause I'm feeling you 
Something in my heart 
Are you feeling me yo?

Are you loving me, yo? 
Tell me if it's our time 
Do I blow your mind? 
Cause I need to know 
Put my life on the line 
I'mma give you my heart 
All the love that I own 
But before I do that 
Are you feeling me yo? 
Anything for you 
Cause I'm big on you 
But I need to know 
Are you loving me, yo?
