Eyes so bright, so big and wide
Make you feel so strange
Somewhere deep inside
It's the face of an angel
Soul of the devil may care

How I'd love to know
What goes on in there

She needs your love
She needs it every day
But speak of love
See her laugh and run away

Julia, which way will you go
Julia, I wanna know
Julia, only the moon and stars
Julia, know just where you are
Julia

See the dance that needs no alibi
Oh you don't need to dream
When you know you can fly

She needs your love
She needs it every day
But speak of love
See her laugh and run away

Julia, which way will you go
Julia, I wanna know
Julia, only the moon and stars
Julia, know just where you are
Julia
