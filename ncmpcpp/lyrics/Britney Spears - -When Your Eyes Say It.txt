This is by will ford not britney spears
You want the truth
Here it is

Manufactured
Is this hop pop industry
I know
Cause they tried to do it to me
Don't you let them
Take away your eyes
Be who you are and stop the sweet talk of lies

Bridge:
And you never gonna see me lipsynch
And you never gonna see me try to cheat
Cause I'm not the one who wont break it down
Follow me, people see that I'm gonna below the roof of of thistown

Chorus:
Tired of the clothes that look like me
Tired of you people sayin "Britney"
Tired of the pop that's a flop
That should never be
On tv and in your teen magazines
Tired of the crap I take each day
Tryin to do my song, tryin to do it my way
Tired of the pop that's a flop
That should never be
On tv and in your teen magazines

Shame
It's the game you play for fame
But give it some time
You won't remember their names
Some you will, some you won't
Their the one hit wonder remedies
Who cannot sing a note
Bridge

Chorus 2x

Yeah yeah 4x

It's the same old game
Over and over

Bridge

Chorus 2x
