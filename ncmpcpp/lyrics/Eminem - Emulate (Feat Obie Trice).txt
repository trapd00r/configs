[Talking: Obie Trice]
New shit Obie Trice, Eminem
Get familiar wit it

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Obie the person that came up and deverted
Cause of nervousness
That was solely the homie's verdict
It was worth it
Cause he changed, became so I observed it
Certain such of a purpose
Its like a different version
So much hurtin' and pain
Gave him game for certain
Thats why its curtains at his murder if you get him worked up
I'm so assertive on these motherfuckers actin' tougher
Had enough of
Isolating myself in a room
Writing poems for songs doin' the same in school
Now look what he became a fool
Cause he learned how to sustain his two
And obtain fame from you
Living hard but still Julliard
A god walks and ain't spent a day in a pew
Regardless of this I draw visual pictures when a nigga vents
So welcome to the art department

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I stimulate the brain mimick
Emulate the sane
Sick of people thinkin' its a fuckin' mimick when it ain't
Clinically insane
Brain is on Venus
Suck your anus (Uranus)
Label me a genius if you ever seen as you would say
He may seem as though hes plain normal
If you ever meet him greet him with a shake see he ain't as mean as what they say
See the thing is maybe he can't always think of things to say so hes vague
So they mistake him for just bein' crazed
You don't think hes strange
You turn around and tell him please and thanks
And catch him flippin' you off with his pants down
Hands around
His Scrotum tuckin' his fuckin' Penis between his legs

[Talking: Eminem]
This is Shade 45
You know how motherfuckin' serious this shit is?
This shit is so motherfuckin' serious
