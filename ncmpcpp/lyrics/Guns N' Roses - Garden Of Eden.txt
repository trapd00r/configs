It's a critical solution
And the east coast got the blues
It's a mass of confusion
Like the lies they sell to you

You got a glass jawed toothache
Of a mental disease
An they be runnin' round back
See 'em line up on their knees
'Cause the kiss ass sycophants
Throwin' penance at your feet

When they got nowhere to go
Watch 'em come in off the streets
While they're bangin' out front
Inside their slammin' to the cruch
Go on an throw me to the lions
And the whole damn screamin' bunch
'Cause the pissed-off rip-offs
'R' everywhere you turn
Tell me how a generation's
Ever s'posed to learn
This fire is burnin'
and it's out of control
It's not a problem you can stop
It's rock n' roll

I read it on a wall
It went straight to my head
It said "Dance to the tension
of a world on edge"
We got racial violence
And who'll cast the first stone
And sex is used anyway it can be
Sometimes when I look out
It's hard to see the day
It's a feelin' you can have it
It's not mine to take away

Lost in the garden of Eden
Said we're lost in the garden of Eden
And there's no one's gonna believe      this
But we're lost in the garden of Eden
This fire is burnin'
and it's out of control
It's not a problem you can stop
It's rock n' roll
Suck on that

Looking through this point of view
There's no way I'm gonna fit in
Don't ya tell me what my eyes see
Don't ya tell me who to believe in
I ain't superstitious
But I know when somethin's wrong
I've been draggin' my heels
With a bitch called hope
Let the undercurrent drag me along

Lost in the garden of Eden
Said we're lost in the garden of Eden
And there's no one's gonna believe this
But we're lost in the garden of Eden

Most organized religions make
A mockery of humanity
Our governments are dangerous
And out of control
The garden of Eden is just another    graveyard
Said if they had someone to buy it
Said I'm sure they'd sell my soul

This fire is burnin'
and it's out of control
It's not a problem you can stop
It's rock n' roll
Lost in the garden of Eden
(An we ain't talkin' about no poison apple or some missin' rib ya hear)
Said we're lost in the garden of Eden
And there's no one's gonna believe this
Said we're lost in the garden of Eden
This fire is burnin'
and it's out of control
It's not a problem you can stop
It's rock n' roll
