Come to me
I'll take care of you
Protect you
Calm, calm down
You're exhausted
Come lie down
You don't have to explain
I understand

You know
That I adore you
You know
That I love you
So don't make me say it
It would burst the bubble
Break the charm

Jump off
Your building's on fire
And I'll catch you
I'll catch you
Destroy all that is keeping you down
And then I'll nurse you
I'll nurse you
I'll protect you

You know
That I adore you
You know 
That I love you 
So don't make me say it
It would burst the bubble
Break the charm
