here I go(fade)
Alright
here I go(fade to loud)
Ooh hey,yeah yeah

Hush, just stop,stop,stop
There’s nothing you can do or say, baby
I’ve had enough
I’m not your property as from today, baby
You might think that I won't make it on my own
But now I’m

Stronger than yesterday
Now it’s nothing but my way
My loneliness ain’t killing me no more
I,I'm stronger

Than I ever thought that I could be, baby
I used to go with the flow
Didn’t really care ‘bout me
You might think that I can’t take it, but you’re wrong
'Cause now I’m

Stronger than yesterday
Now it’s nothing but my way
My loneliness ain’t killing me no more
I,I'm stronger

Oh Come on, now
Oh, yeah

Here I go, on my own
I don’t need nobody, better off alone
Here I go, on my own now
I don’t need nobody, not anybody
Here I go(fade) alright, here I go(fade to loud)


Stronger than yesterday
it’s nothing but my way
My loneliness ain’t killing me no more
I,I'm

Stronger than yesterday
Now it’s nothing but my way
My loneliness ain’t killing me no more
I,I'm stronger


Now i'm Stronger than yesterday
Now it’s nothing but my way
My loneliness ain’t killing me no more(me no more)
I am stronger
