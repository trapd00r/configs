Look at us break our bonds in this kitchen
Look at us rallying all our defenses
Look at us waging war in our bedroom
Look at us jumping ship in our dialogues

That doesn't show up as bigger symptoms out there
So why spend all our time dressing our bandages
When we've the ultimate key to the cause right here
Our underneath

Look at us form our cliques in our sandbox
Look at us micro kids with both our hearts blocked
Look at us turn away from all the rough spots
Look at dictatorship on my own block

There is no difference in what we're doing in here
That doesn't show up as bigger symptoms out there
So why spend all our time dressing our bandages
When we've the ultimate key to the cause right here
Our underneath

When shine on the outside springs from the root
Spotlight on these seeds of simpler reasons
This core, born into form, starts in my living room

There is no difference in what we're doing in here
That doesn't show up as bigger symptoms out there
So why spend all our time dressing our bandages
When we've the ultimate key to the cause right here
Our underneath
