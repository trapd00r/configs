Now everybody from the 313 
 Put your mothefucking hands and follow me
 Everybody from the 313 
 Put your mothefucking hands up
 Look Look
 
 Now while he stands tough
 Notice that this man did not had his hands up
 The free world got you gased up
 Now who's afraid of the big bad wolf
 
 1, 2, 3 and to the 4
 1 pac , 2 pac, 3 pac, 4
 4 pac, 3 pac, 2 pac, 1
 You're pac, he's pac, no pacs, none
 
 This guy aint no mother-fuckin MC,
 I know everything he's got to say against me,
 I am white, I am a fuckin bum, I do live in a trailer with my mom,
 My boy future is an uncle tom.
 I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob who shoots
 himself in the leg with his own gun,
 I did get jumped by all 6 of you chumps
 And Wink did fuck my girl,
 I'm still standin here screamin "FUCK THE FREE WORLD!"
 Don't ever try to judge me dude 
 You don't know what the fuck i've been through
 
 But i know something about you
 You went to Crankbook, that's a private school
 What's the matter dawg? You embarrased?
 This is guy's a gangster, he's real name's Clarence
 
 And Clarence lives at home with both parents
 And Clarence's parents have a real good marriage
 This guy don't wanna battle, He's shook
 'Cause there no such things as half-way crooks
 He's scared to death
 He's scared to look in his fuckin yearbook, fuck Crankbook
 
 Fuck the beat, i go acapella
 Fuck a papa doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer, fuck everybody
 Fuck y'all if you doubt me
 I'm a piece of fucking white trash, i say it proudly 
 And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outty, 
 Here, tell this people something they dont know about me.
