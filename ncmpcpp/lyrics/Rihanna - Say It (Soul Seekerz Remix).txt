(Intro)
You should tell me whats buggin you
And Imma tell ya bout me
Make a wish and tell me your deepest thoughts
And Imma make it easy
Make a wish tell me whats buggin you
And Imma tell ya bout me
Make a wish and tell me your deepest thoughts
And Imma make it easy

(Verse 1)
Emotions running wild 
I could feel it when I'm next to you,
Something's on ya mind
You wanna stay but wont tell me, 
its about ya secrecy
So what are you tryna hide?
I know what the look means
You hold my hand so tightly,
Whenever we say goodbye
Standing by the door,
I could tell you can't take no more
Blow your secret open wide


(Chorus)
So maybe if you say it
Tell me what it is you likeeee (likee)
Baby baby dont be shyyy (shyy)
Maybe you can spend the nighttt (nii-iii-iightt)
If you say it
But if you playin (not wit it)
Cuz you know what I wanna hear (hearr)
Say it, that'll make it more clear (clearr)
I need to know how you feel
So baby why wont you (say it), say it (say it)

(Bridge 1)
Wont', won't you tell me
What, what's going on
Why, why you waitin' on it
What you waiting for?
Soon you should tell me or I might be gone
But I'm here for you baby,
You should put me on

(Verse 2)
I won't shoot you down,
Make you feel some kinda way
If you'll be honest with me
Put away your pride, 
I can see it in your face 
You want me permanently (unh)
Like how i wine when we dancing,
I know how it happened
And I'm right there wit you
But I won't be the first to out myself out there,
The feeling is mutual
But I bet if you

(Chorus)
Say it
Tell me what it is you likeeee (likee)
Baby baby dont be shyyy (shyy)
Maybe you can spend the nighttt (nii-iii-iightt)
If you say it
But if you playin (not wit it)
Cuz you know what i wanna hear (hearr)
Say it, that'll make it more clear (clearr)
I need to know how you feel
so baby why wont you (say it), say it (say it)

(Bridge 2 2x)
Your eyes steady talking
And your tryna fight it
But some things baby are not worth hiding
And we can find heaven,
If we go look together
So won't, won't you tell me,
And get it off your chest

(Chorus)
So maybe if you say it (saa-ayyyy)
Tell me what it is you likeeee (what it is you like) (likee)
Baby baby dont be shyyy (shyy) (oh no no)
Maybe you can spend the nighttt (nii-iii-iightt)
If you say it
But if you playin (not wit it)
Cuz you know what I wanna hear (you know what I wanna hear) (hearr)
Say it, that'll make it more clear (so boy say it loud and clear)
I need to know how you feel
So baby why wont you (say it), say it (say it) (saa-ayyyy ittt)

(Bridge 2 2x)
Your eyes steady talking
And your tryna fight it
But some things baby are not worth hiding
And we can find heaven,
If we go look together
So won't, won't you tell me,
And get it off your chest

(Chorus)
Say it
Tell me what it is you likeeee (likee)
Baby baby dont be shyyy (shyy)
Maybe you can spend the nighttt (nii-iii-iightt)
If you say it
But if you playin (not wit it)
Cuz you know what i wanna hear (hearr)
Say it, that'll make it more clear (clearr)
I need to know how you feel
