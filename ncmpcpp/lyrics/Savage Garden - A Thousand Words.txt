We stumble in a tangled web, 
decaying friendships almost dead 
And hide behind a mask of lies 
We twist and turn and we avoid, 
all hope of salvage now devoid 
I see the truth inside your eyes 
So take all this noise into your brain 
and send it back again 
I'll bear the cost, shed my skin, call 
you up and then... 
I'll say the words out loud 

[chorus:]
You could resurrect a thousand 
words to deceive me more and more 
A thousand words will give the 
reasons why I don't need you 
anymore 

Time manipulates your heart, 
preconceptions torn apart 
Begin to doubt my state of mind 
But I won't go down on what I said 
I won't retract convictions read 
I may perplex, but I'm not blind 
So take all this noise into your brain 
and send it back again 
I'll bear the cost, shed my skin, call 
you up and then... 
I'll say the words out loud 

[chorus ]

I'll say the words out loud. I'll say a 
thousand words or more 

Manipulation. Fabrication. 
Conversation. Annihilation 
I'll say a thousand words or more 
Damnation. Frustration. Elevation. 
Procreation 
I'll say a thousand words or more 

[repeat chorus]
