Come notice me  
And take my hand  
So why are we  
Strangers when  
Our love is strong  
Why carry on without me?  
And everytime I try to fly  
I fall without my wings  
I feel so small  
I guess I need you baby  
And everytime I see you in my dreams  
I see your face, it's haunting me  
I guess I need you baby  
I make believe  
That you are here  
It's the only way  
I see clear  
What have I done  
You seem to move on easy  
And everytime I try to fly  
I fall without my wings  
I feel so small  
I guess I need you baby  
And everytime I see you in my dreams  
I see your face, you're haunting me  
I guess I need you baby  
I may have made it rain  
Please forgive me  
My weakness caused you pain  
And this song is my sorry  
Ohhhh  
At night I pray  
That soon your face  
Will fade away  
And everytime I try to fly  
I fall without my wings  
I feel so small  
I guess I need you baby  
And everytime I see you in my dreams  
I see your face, you're haunting me  
I guess I need you baby
