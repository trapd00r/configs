You are such a workaholic boy
That you kill everybody's joy
Fill your head with some time to lose
With some time to lose

Sing sang sung, sing me a song
Do de dum, don't be so down
Ring rang rung, give me a ring
Please please please don't be so long

What are we doing here my friend
Take a breath, push your pain away
Nothing lasts it's better that way
It's better that way

Sing sang sung, sing me a song
Do de dum, don't be so down
Ring rang rung, give me a ring
Please please please don't be so long

(Repeat Chorus)
