Take heed, dear heart
Once apart, she can touch nor me nor you
Dressed as one
A wolf will betray a lamb

Lead astray the gazers
The razors on your seducing skin
In the meadow of sinful thoughts
Every flower's a perfect one

To paradise with pleasure haunted 
Haunted by fear

A sin for him
Desire within
Desire within
A burning veil
For the bride too dear for him
A sin for him
Desire within
Desire within
Fall in love with your deep dark sin

I am the Fallen
You are what my sins enclose
Lust is not as creative
As its discovery

To paradise with pleasure haunted
Haunted by fear

A sin for him
Desire within
Desire within
A burning veil
For the bride too dear for him
A sin for him
Desire within
Desire within
Fall in love with your deep dark sin

Bless me, undress me
Pick your prey in a wicked way
God I must confess...
...I do envy the sinners

A sin for him
Desire within
A burning veil
For the bride too dear for him

A sin for him
Desire within
Desire within
A burning veil
For the bride too dear for him
A sin for him
Desire within
Desire within
Fall in love with your deep dark sin
