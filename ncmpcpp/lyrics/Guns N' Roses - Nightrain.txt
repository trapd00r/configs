-Instrumental Intro-

-Intro-
Loaded like a freight train
Flyin' like an aeroplane 
Feelin' like a space brain 
One more time tonight, lookout

-Verse-
Well I'm a west coast struttin'
One bad mother 
Got a rattlesnake suitcase
Under my arm
Said I'm a mean machine 
Been drinkin' gasoline
An' honey you can make my motor hum 

Well, I got one chance left
In a nine life cat
I got a dog eat dog sly smile
I got a Molotov cocktail with a match to go 
I smoke my cigarette with style 
An' I can tell you honey 
You can make my money tonight

Wake up late, honey put on your clothes
Take your credit card to the liquor store 
Well, that's one for you and two for me by tonight

-Stick-
I'll be loaded like a freight train 
Flyin' like an aeroplane 
Feelin' like a space brain 
One more time tonight

-Chorus-
I'm on the nightrain 
Bottoms up 
I'm on the nightrain 
Fill my cup 
I'm on the nightrain 
Ready to crash and burn 
I never learn 

I'm on the nightrain 
I love that stuff 
I'm on the nightrain 
And I can never get enough 
I'm on the nightrain 
Never to return, no

-Guitar Solo-

-Stick-
Loaded like a freight train 
Flyin' like an aeroplane 
Speedin' like a space brain 
One more tonight

-Chorus-
I'm on the nightrain 
An' I'm lookin' for some 
I'm on the nightrain 
So's I can leave this slum
I'm on the nightrain 
And I'm ready to crash and burn 

Nightrain 
Bottoms up 
I'm on the nightrain
Fill my cup 
I'm on the nightrain
Uh, uh, uh, oh yeah 

I'm on the nightrain
Love that stuff 
I'm on the nightrain
An I can never get enough
Ridin' the nightrain 
I guess I 
I guess, I guess, I guess I never learn

On the Nightrain 
Float me home 
Ooh, I'm on the nightrain 
Ridin' the nightrain
Never to return

Nightrain
