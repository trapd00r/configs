It is the evening of the day
I sit and watch the children play
Smiling faces I can see but not for me
I sit and watch as tears go by

My riches can't buy everything
I want to hear the children sing
But all I hear is the sound 
Of rain falling on the ground
I sit and watch as tears go by

It is the evening of the day
I sit and watch the children play
Doing things I used to do
Oh but where are you
I sit and watch as tears go by
