[Proof]
Yo, aiyo turn the heads and the mics up
We got the Dreadknaughts, you know wha' I'm sayin'?
Super MC, ya know wha' I mean?
Bugz, Dirty and all that, all that shit
You know wha' I'm sayin'?
Desperados with the cars, Eminem 

[Eminem]
Chauvinist pig, drove in this Big Lincoln
Till it went over the bridge
Jumped out and dove in the ditch
Broke in a mobile home and stole a stove and fridge
Kidnapped the parents and left the ransom note for the kids
I'ma go for your mids
Here's a body blow for your ribs
While you're clutching your stomach and bleeding all over your bitch
I know where you live, your girl showed me your crib
Unless she told me a fib
Then I'ma have both of ya dead
Burning incense, facing a murder sentence
Under intent, for investigation for killing infants
While I sit in padded rooms doing shrooms
Having visions of dead pregnant women wit' brooms jammed in they wounds
Slit your carpet and rugs, and fucked your apartment up
Sticking up all the drugs, and jumping in garbage trucks
I'm from the shitty slums that look like the city dumps
Give you a kidney punch, and mug you to get me lunch
See me every summer, layin' up against the dumpster
With a one hundred dollar jumper, smothered in southern comfort
Got my Slim Shady sticker on your mother's bumper
She came home screamin', a bunch of motherfuckers jumped her

[Proof]
Aiyo
Pursue to list 'em, there's no need to diss 'em
They be behavin', make sure your whole breathing system
Twist them like big caps, who wants to hear that
Rap, murder rates, and I snap vertebrates 
Collapse further states, my tribe reserves the grave
Your pack deserve a crate, in fact the word is fake
I'll cook you slow like egg sufficient nuts
I'm holding vandanna like seven great-molested sluts
Calling me a bitch nigga, you need to stop
Reality, one on one
How many times you got dropped
I'm cut throat when any track runs, I smack none's
It's the rough method that makes Muslims run and pack guns
I'm volcanic (volcanic), the sermon preacher (preacher)
Burning MC's most wanted by Herman Kefa
You tried to get a squad, they was like "Money oh no"
Leavin' you brain dead, hittin' trees with Sonny Bono
I kick without a dojo, D-12 slow flow
Shoot down your mother ship and pimp slap mojo
No pro wanna go knuckle blades with renegade
Nigga tried to go pop, and plus they minute made
My lieutenant spray your brigade, and trampled your flow
Big P, the reason MC's canceled they shows
The truth will hurt, see Proof will work your shame in it
The best part of your show is when you put my name in it
My squad, godly, fearin' shit hardly
So I hope when I die, I dope like Chris Farley
Fuck that

[Bugz]
Who run shit, watch these drums hit
You dove head first into some old dumb shit
Here's a can of ass whip, for you to come get
Your clique made their trip, I made them hoes submit
Ask your girl, she knows the scoop don't fuck with Bugz bitch
I'll chop off her titty, have you sucking one tit
Them pink belly niggas is who you run wit'
Making half ass songs, shitty snares and one kick
I hate your damn sound, don't like it one bit
You can make a double album, won't have one hit
Your entire outfit is on some bullshit
And there's not a damn one that I can't out wit'
I admit, that my style is unfit
For mamma's baby boy because I'm on some dumb shit
Like I commit arsony, get harm quick
You pull the alarm switch, I'll stab you in your armpit
Now who the nitwit wanna come get wit'
This egotistic, hip-hop fundal mentalisitic
Don't risk it, you'll get your shit split
Now keep your distance, and keep existence
I'm the persistent when it comes to bench shit
I smoked a blunt with my judge before my sentence
I'm relentless to deny you're senseless
Yo bitch, pay my bill that's where the hell your rent went
Fuck that

[Almighty Dreadknaughtz]
I killed competition, with no way out as an opposition
Execute the passengers on the flight my executive decision
Then reminisce on how shady the business
Terrorists asked by Israelis when they visit
Bombed in insentient
One word in three in the making, murdered the exhibition team finish
Beat the ref senseless
No timeout extended play papers over your intermission
And increasing the battlefield with the blood of Christians
Cryin' for the messiah, but he don't listen
I pop my wing when I top the stove frame boil sizzling
I fight a maniac cook, I do damage to kitchens
Fuck Home Depot, I demolition
When I home improve, I'll be there to fix it
For my school is supervision, for down finical aid smoked up my intuition
Only hang out with rappers with explicit lyrics
And pistol grip punks with a beef, bitch do you wanna get eaten

I got a mind full of troubles 
Everything is in doubles
I buy my guns in couples
No time to replace fumbles
'Cause MC's come and MC's go, we both flow
Injured from head to toe
No fit a model, we full throttle
You stuck in low, incapable to master flow
Everything is tactical, living mathematical
Watch master flow, unleash and let go
I shit like lava, original designer, married to marijuana since a minor
Making it a chance to see my battleship could get you wet like fibs, what
Applying death-defying feets, maintain to keep my peace
Flow like to see, when I release these beats over concrete

My president transitions has taken place
As eyes spread folk ally on the M-I-CR-O
Power he's cyphin' not quality, I deal it
Lays the track and made it real, I know my people feel it
Keep their head bobbin', and the emotional sobbin'
Plus a cultural cipher after shows, hoes slobbin'
Knobs, love the fuckin' flavor of the icing
Plus I'm precision, my double edge will continue slicin'
