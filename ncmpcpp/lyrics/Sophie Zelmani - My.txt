My mind is just where you are, you are, you are
And I'm tired of going that far
My heart beats so fast, so fast, so fast
Please slow it down so it will last
My dreams always always always confuse
They are to no use
I'm going, going, going nowhere not until you're here
My life is giving, giving, giving back to me all reasons to be
My love is so hard, so hard, so hard to feel and it won't ever leave
