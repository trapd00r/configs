Confidence is a must, cockiness is a plus
Edginess is a rush
Edges, I like 'em rough
A man with a Midas touch
Intoxicate me, I'm a rush
Stop, you're making me blush
People are looking at us

I don't think you know (know)
I'm checking you so hard, so hard,
Wonder if you know you're on my radar (on my radar)
On my radar (on my radar)
And yep, I notice you. I know it's you
Choose, don't wanna lose you
You're on my radar (on my radar)
On my radar (on my radar)

When you walk (when you walk)
And when you talk (when you talk)
I get the tingle, I wanna mingle
That's what I want (that's what I want)
Hey, listen, baby, turn up the fader
I'm tryin' to make you understand you're on my radar (on my radar)
On my radar (on my radar)

On my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar

Interesting sense of style, ten million dollar smile
Think I can handle that? Animal in the sack
His eyes see right to my soul, I surrender self-control
Catch me looking again, falling right into my plan

I don't think you know (know)
I'm checking it, so hard, so hard,
Wonder if you know you're on my radar (on my radar)
On my radar (on my radar)
And yep, I notice you. I know it's you
Choose, don't wanna lose you
You're on my radar (on my radar)
On my radar (on my radar)

When you walk (when you walk)
And when you talk (when you talk)
I get the tingle, I wanna mingle
That's what I want (that's what I want)
Hey, listen, baby, turn up the fader
I'm tryin' to make you understand you're on my radar (on my radar)
On my radar (on my radar)

On my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar

On my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar

I got my eye on you and I can't let you get away

Hey, baby
Whether it's now or later, I got you
You can't shake me (no)
'Cause I got you on my radar
Whether you like it or not, it ain't gonna stop
'Cause I got you on my radar (I got you)
'Cause I got you on my radar

I'm checking it, so hard, so hard,
Wonder if you know you're on my radar (on my radar)
On my radar (on my radar)
And yep, I notice you. I know it's you
Choose, don't wanna lose you
You're on my radar (on my radar)
On my radar (on my radar)

When you walk (when you walk)
And when you talk (when you talk)
I get the tingle, I wanna mingle
That's what I want (that's what I want)
Hey, listen, baby, turn up the fader
I'm tryin' to make you understand you're on my radar (on my radar)
On my radar (on my radar)
