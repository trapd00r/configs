I am the key to the lock in your house
That keeps your toys in the basement
And if you get too far inside
You'll only see my reflection
It's always best when the colour is off
I am the pick in the ice
Do not cry out or hit the alarm
You know we're friends till we die

That either way he turns, I'll be there
Open up your skull, I'll be there climbing up the walls

It's always best when the light is off
It's always better on the outside
Fifteen blows to the back of my head
Fifteen blows to your mind
So lock the kids in a safe tonight
Shut the eyes in the cupboard
I've got the smell of a local man
Who's got the loneliest feeling

But either way you turn, I'll be there
Open up your skull, I'll be there climbing up the walls

Climbing up the walls, climbing up the walls
