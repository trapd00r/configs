All of that thick time without you
Has made me so thick and drunk
And it's okay to laugh about it
I said it's okay to laugh about it 

Running twice as fast to stay in the same place
Don't catch my breath until the end of the day
And I'd rather be shot in the face
Than hear what you're going to say

One day the wind will come up
And you'll come up empty again
And who'll be laughing then?
You'll come up empty again
There's no reason, no explanation
So play the violins

It's always funny until someone gets hurt
And then it's just hilarious
It's always funny until someone gets hurt
And then it's just hilarious

You beat me every time you blink
If only I didn't have time to think
Think about you cracking a smile
Think about you all the while

One day the wind will come up
And you'll come up empty again
And who'll be laughing then?
You'll come up empty again
There's no reason, no explanation
So play the violins

On the ricochet, it's going to hit you
It's always funny until someone gets hurt
On the ricochet, it's going to hit you
It's always funny until someone gets hurt
You can laugh at me when it misses you
And you can laugh at me when it misses you

It's always funny until someone gets hurt
And then it's just hilarious
