The reproach on your daughter's most beautiful face
Made me wonder just how she could know
Of that something that happened between you and me
So much more than a long time ago

Her mother, I can see, lives within her still
Cause she looked at me with her eyes
Though I had only just met her right then
I feel that she peeled back my guilty disguise

Did I break the thread, or did you break the thread?
Well at this point we could ask who cares
As for the promises broken and frayed
Well it's 19 years late for repairs

The grey pewter vase held the deep red rose,
One piece of coral shone white,
By the brass candlestick near your red velvet coat,
Is everything I can recall of one night

Will you please tell me why I remember these things
After all of this time, I don't know
I must have left all those feelings inside
Cause that year I had no courage to show

Was I the name you could never pronounce?
Or did I even figure at all?
All of this happened before she was born
Did I shadow her young pencil marks on the wall

Still I am sure I was only but one
Of a number who darkened that door
Of your home and your hearth and your family and wife
Who'd been darkened so often before

And the red leaf looks to the hard gray stone
To each other, they know what they mean
Somewhere, their future is still yet to come
In ways that are yet as of now unforeseen
