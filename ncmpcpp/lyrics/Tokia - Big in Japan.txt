Winter’s cityside
Crystal bits of snowflakes
All around my head and in the wind
I had no illusions
That I’d ever find a glimpse
Of summer’s heatwaves in your eyes
You did what you did to me
Now it’s history I see
Here’s my comeback on the road again
Things will happen while they can
I will wait here for my man tonight
It’s easy when you’re big in Japan

Aah when you’re big in Japan-tonight…
Big in Japan-be-tight…
Big in Japan… ooh the eastern sea’s so blue
Big in Japan-alright,
Pay! — Then I’ll sleep by your side
Things are easy when you’re big in Japan
Oh when you’re big in Japan

Neon on my naked skin, passing silhouettes
Of strange illuminated mannequins
Shall I stay here at the zoo
Or should I go and change my point of view
For other ugly scenes
You did what you did to me
Now it’s history I see
Here’s my comeback on the road again
Things will happen while they can
I will wait here for my man tonight
It’s easy when you’re big in Japan

Aah when you’re big in Japan-tonight…
Big in Japan-be-tight…
Big in Japan… ooh the eastern sea’s so blue
Big in Japan-alright, pay!
Then I’ll sleep by your side
Things are easy when you’re big in Japan
