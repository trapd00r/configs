(Spoken:)
I know you've been waiting, yeah
I've been watching you, yeah
I know you wanna get up, yeah
Come on

Chorus:

Everybody, come on, dance and sing
Everybody, get up and do your thing
Everybody, come on, dance and sing
Everybody, get up and do your thing

Let the music take control
Find a groove and let yourself go
When the room begins to sway
You know what I'm trying to say

Come on, take a chance
Get up and start the dance
Let the D.J. shake you
Let the music take you

(chorus)

Let your body take a ride
Feel the beat and step inside
Music makes the world go 'round
You can turn your troubles upside down

Gonna have to change your mind
Gonna leave your troubles behind
Your body gets the notion
When your feet can make the motion

(chorus, repeat)

Dance and sing, get up and do your thing (repeat 3 times)

(Spoken:)
I know you've been waiting, yeah, yeah
I see you sitting there, I've been watching you
Across the room, yeah, yeah
I've been watching you, I see you sitting there by yourself
Yeah, yeah
Come on, come on, come on

(chorus)

Let the music take control
Find a groove and let yourself go
When the room begins to sway
You know what I'm trying to say

(chorus, repeat and fade)
