There are times I think eternal life ain't such a bad gig 
Smoke all you want and see the planets 
If and only if they find a way to cure the longing 
The distant panic 
Someday, I'm telling you 
They'll make a memory machine 
To wax our hearts to a blinding sheen 
To wash away the grief 
Someday, I'm telling you 
They'll make a memory machine 
To wax our hearts to a blinding sheen 
To wash away the grief 
There are folks that say to have a soul you've got to suffer 
Well lately I've had my RDA of that 
And call it fascist but I know that someday happy 
Will be all that matters 
Someday, I'm telling you 
They'll make a memory machine 
To wax our hearts to a blinding sheen 
To wash away the grief 
Someday, I'm telling you 
They'll make a memory machine 
To wax our hearts to a blinding sheen 
To wash away the grief 
Poetry, Aldous Huxley—yeah, yeah, yeah, it'll be a relief 
If they can make machines to save us labor 
Someday they'll do our hearts the very same favor 
The wails of ruined lives brought to a halt 
By the serene hum of computers in air-conditioned vaults
