Send "Caged Bird (feat. Katrina Ford)" Ringtone to your Cell The wind did blow 
Across the valley
So we can run
Under illusion

This one dream
I see is true
The caged bird
Sings the blues
For you

This one dream
I see is true
The caged bird
Sings the blues
For you

I know where we can fly
Into, into thin air
Something to believe
Or beware
Into thin air
Something to believe
Or beware
Into thin air

Oh I know where we can fly

Hold, Hold, Hold, Hold on on on on
Hold, Hold, Hold, Hold on on on on

Oh someway
To break the cage
And route the Rage to love
Love

Oh for so many nights
A prayer to breach
That star you’ll
Reach tonight

Into, into thin air
Something to believe
Or beware
Into thin air
No light despair
Into thin air
Something to believe

Hold on
Hold on

...It’s all a dream
It seems to
Feel the air you breathe
There’s so much needing
We are believing...

Hold, Hold, Hold, Hold on on on on
Hold, Hold, Hold, Hold on on on on
