[originally performed by Foreigner]

I gotta take a little time 
A little time to think things over 
I better read between the lines 
In case I need it when I'm older 

Now this mountain I must climb 
Feels like a world upon my shoulders 
I through the clouds I see love shine 
It keeps me warm as life grows colder 

In my life there's been heartache and pain 
I don't know if I can face it again 
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far 
To change this lonely life 

I wanna know what love is 
I want you to show me 
I wanna feel what love is 
I know you can show me 

I'm gonna take a little time 
A little time to look around me 
I've got nowhere left to hide 
It looks like love has finally found me 

In my life there's been heartache and pain 
I don't know if I can face it again 
I can't stop now, I've traveled so far 
To change this lonely life 

I wanna know what love is 
I want you to show me 
I wanna feel what love is 
I know you can show me 

I wanna know what love is 
I want you to show me 
And I wanna feel, I want to feel what love is 
And I know, I know you can show me 

Let's talk about love 
I wanna know what love is, the love that you feel inside 
I want you to show me, and I'm feeling so much love 
I wanna feel what love is, no, you just cannot hide 
I know you can show me, yeah
