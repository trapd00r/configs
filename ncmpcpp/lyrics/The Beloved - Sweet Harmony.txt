Is it right or wrong
Try to find a place 
We can all belong?
Be as one 
Try to get on by
If we unify?
We should really try... 

All this time 
Spinning round and round
Made the same mistakes
That we've always found 
Surely now
We could move along 
Make a better world?
No it can't be wrong

Let's come together
Right now
Oh yeah 
In sweet harmony

Let's come together
Right now
Oh yeah 
In sweet harmony

Let's come together
Right now
Oh yeah 
In sweet harmony

Let's come together
Right now
Oh yeah 

Time is running out
Let there be no doubt
We should sort things out
If we care
Like we say we do
Not just empty words
For a week or two

Make the world 
Your priority
Try to live your life
Ecologically 
Play a part
In a greater scheme
Try to live the dream
On a wider scene

Let's come together
Right now
Oh yeah 
In sweet harmony

Let's come together
Right now
Oh yeah 
In sweet harmony
