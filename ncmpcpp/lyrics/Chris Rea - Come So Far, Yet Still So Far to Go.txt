I'm chained to the highway, there's no other way for me
Always looking for a new day, always a dream ahead of me
Seems like it's so many lifetimes, through the sunshine, rain and snow

Yeah I come so far, but I still got so far to go
Yes I come so far, but I still got so far to go

Solo

I'm gonna end up dyin' my body is listening for you
But you may as well be gone already if you say dreams can't come true
There's been good times there's been bad, but I still love the show

Yeah I've come so far, but I still got so far to go
Yeah I come so far, but I still got so far to go
Yeah I come so far, but I still got so far to go
Still got so far to go

Solo

Yeah I've come so far, but I still got so far to go
