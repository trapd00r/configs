My friends and I meet hours before 
We make some homemade pizza 
We do some funny bits back and forth 
My knees buckle, I laugh so hard 

We might end three sheets to wind and who 
knows where we'll wind up 
All I know is there's a car waiting and 
we'll figure that out after 

I have to keep my eye on my old friend from 
high school 
We've known each other for the longest time 
She has trouble with her limits so to speak 
She can hoist a really good kick in the butt 
when she's excited 
She doesn't do it so much anymore cuz we're 
all on to her 

Bring on the tequila ohhhhhh 
On fire on tequila ohhhhhh 
Hostess most on tequila ohhhhhh 
Bestest friends on tequila ohhhhhh 

Then there's my other pretty friend from high school 
The predator in me is put to shame by the 
predator in her 
I know I've reeled it in but it'll be interesting 
to see how much she's done as well 

Then there's my friend from Chigago, God do 
I love all people from Chicago 
All ready to light up the barbeque and be the 
heartbeat of debauchery 

Bring on the tequila ohhhhhh 
On fire on tequila ohhhhhh 
Hostess most on tequila ohhhhhh 
Bestest friends on tequila ohhhhhh 

Then there's my Canadian friend, what a 
fabulous mom she's become 
She's been tortured in this sense for the last 
many of months for obvious reasons 
She was like ‘hey, where was this part of you when 
I wasn't pregnant?' 
I laughed and did a shot in her honor as I 
conversed with her belly 

Bring on the tequila ohhhhhh 
On fire on tequila ohhhhhh 
Hostess most on tequila ohhhhhh 
Bestest friends on tequila ohhhhhh 

Then there's my cupid friend 
She sure knows how to dress, that one 
She's a wise and worldly girl but you gotta 
watch that medication 
Our favorite beverage is taken to a whole other 
level on it 
I'm not worried about her, I'll coast around 
the room while I trust she'll temper 

My brother came to visit me, now he's used to 
hanging with me and cracking up 
But he had no idea about my built up tolerance, 
no idea about how manipulative I'd become 
I would surreptitiously put it in front of him 
without him asking 
In a pretty little shot glass 
His smirk and cackle would only egg me on 

Bring on the tequila ohhhhhh 
On fire on tequila ohhhhhh 
Hostess most on tequila ohhhhhh 
Bestest friends on tequila ohhhhhh.
