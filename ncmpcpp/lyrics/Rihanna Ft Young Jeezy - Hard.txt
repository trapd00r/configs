They can say whateva
I'ma do whateva
No pain is foreva
Yup, you know this

Tougher than a lion
Ain't no need in tryin'
I live where the sky ends
Yup, you know this

Never lyin', true tella
That Rihanna reign just won't let up
All black on, black top shades
Black top Mayyybach

I'ma rock this shit like fashion as in
goin' til they sayyy stop
And my, runway never looked so clear
But the hottest bitch in heels right here

No fear, and while you are getting your cry on
I'm getting my fly onnn
Sincere, I see you aimin' at my pedestal
I betta let ya know

That I, I, I, I'm so hard
A yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard

So hard, so hard, so hard, so hard

All up on it
Know you wanna clone it
Ain't like me
That chick too phony
Ride this beat, beat, beat like a pony
Meet me at the top (top, top)
It's gettin' lonely

Who think they test me now
Run through yo town
I'll shut it down
Brilliant, resilient
Fan mail from 27 million

And I want it all
It's gonna take more than that
hope that ain't all you got
I need it all
The money, the fame, the cars, the clothes

I can't just let you run up on me like that (all on me like that)
Yeahhh

So I think I betta let ya know

A yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
So hard, so hard, so hard, so hard

Go hard or go home
Back to your residence
Soon the red doors get a block back to the presidents
I used to run my old block like Obama did
You don't gotta believe me, go ask my momma then

Couldn't even come in my room
Smell like a kilo
Look like me and two of my boys playin' casino
Cali's all I keep in my bag in California
Tell them to give me back my swag
They try to clone me

You see my Louis chucks, Louis bag, Louis frames, Louis belt
What that make me
Louis mane

I'm in the all white party wearin' all black
With my new black watch called the heart attack
Cardiac arrest, cardiac wrist
Yeah, they say they're hard
They ain't hard as this

Hard!

One word describes me
And if I wasn't doin' this
You know where I be, too hard

Where them girls talkin' trash
Where them girls talkin' trash
Where they at, where they at, where they at

Where them bloggers at
Where them bloggers at
Where they at, where they at, where they at

Where ya lighters at
Where ya lighters at
Where they at, where they at, where they at
So hard, so hard, so hard, so hard

That I, I, I, I'm so hard
A yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard
A yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard

So hard, so hard, so hard, so hard

That I, I, I
