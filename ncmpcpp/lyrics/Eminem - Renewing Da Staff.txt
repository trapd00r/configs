Send "Renewing the Staff" Ringtone to your Cell If I'm elected for ten terms 
I'm renewing the staff after the inagural 
And hiring all girls as interns 
If I don't like you, I'll snatch you outta your
mic booth 
While you're rappin and pull your right through
the window and fight you 
I'll take you straight to the pavement 
Uppercut you, and scrape your face wit a bracelet

Like a razor that shaved it 
Three drinks and I'm ready to flash 
Runnin on stage in a G-string, wit a bee sting on
my as* (Look!) 
It's probably all cuz I ain't awkward at all 
I just like to walk through the mall, stop, and
talk to the wall 
And have a relapse after I just fought through
withdrawl 
(Hop in the car little girl, I just bought you a
doll) 
The Bad and Evil movement is comin 
Plus the music is pumpin like a pill freak wit a
tube in his stomach 
I write a rhyme a day 
So it's no wonder how come your whole album 
Is soundin like a bunch of sh*t that I would say 
Whether it's one verse or one letter 
I'll probably be the cleverest one that never
gets spun ever 
It's Slim Shady and Tony Touch, it's only us 
The rest of y'all are just stuck in the middle
wit Monie Love
