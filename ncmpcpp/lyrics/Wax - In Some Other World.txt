The prophet born again
The bible in his hand
With fire and brimstone eyes
The saviour on TV
With tax immunity
Donations exorcised.

Who are these men in their ivory towers
Not heaven sent no no.
Worshipping greed in the name of Jesus
Save our souls!
Whoa

In some other world
You'd be branded as thieves
Thrown to your knees
And made to answer.
In some different time
They would lock you away
As mad men I'd say Amen.

Behind the public smile
The politicians guile
So vain and powerful.
Elected for his hair
By people unaware
It's unbelievable.

Brothers in arms robbing the future
Shining in children's eyes.
Shame on this world, shame on our country
shame on you
Whoa

In some other world
You'd be branded as thieves
Thrown to your knees
And made to answer.
In some different time
They would lock you away
As mad men I'd say Amen.

We built you an altar
Instead of an outcast
We made you a king
Respected and wealthy
The verdict is in
The jury is guilty.

Worshipping greed in the name of Jesus
Shame on you!
Whoa

In some other world
You'd be branded as thieves
Thrown to your knees
And made to answer.
In some different time
They would lock you away
As mad men I'd say Amen.

In some other world
You'd be branded as thieves
Thrown to your knees
And made to answer.
In some different time
They would lock you away
As mad men I'd say Amen.
Amen!
