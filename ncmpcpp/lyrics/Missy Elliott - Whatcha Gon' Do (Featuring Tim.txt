[Timbaland]
Dun-dun-dun, dun-dun-DUNN-dun
Dun-dun-dun, dun-dun-DUNN-dun
Dun-dun-dun, dun-dun-DUNN-dun
Dun-dun-dun, dun-dun-DUNN-dun

I be dippin in clubs, girls screamin, "Do you want it Timb?"
Niggaz, playa hatin sayin, "Who the hell is him?"
I'm in the back, gleamin from all that virgin gem
Keep a bunch of pretty models surroundin Timb
I'm over capac'y when it come to makin them beats
Me and Missy makin Y'ALL, move y'all feets
Makin y'all dance and tango, make y'all legs get weak
That's only cause we drop a bunch of heat
That's whatcha gonna expect, comin from my crew
Bunch of dope beats, and a bunch of dope lyrics too
I know that's too much for you to handle dude
Now ask yourself what..

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Whatcha gonna do?  Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do?  Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do?  Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do?  Whatcha gonna do?

[Missy]
When me come in the spot, dem wannn' jock
Dem nasty boy lookin around, with big cocks
Them girls be plottin on how to get the rocks
So I beat that ass to the ground like I'm the cops
AHH, what they gon' say, AHH, don't wan' play
RRR, get 'em in the club, AHH, smokin on hay, HEY
AHH, when I'm in my ride, OH AHH, people walkin by
AH AHH, pistol by my side, B-BRRR, in case dem wan' try

[Chorus]

[Timbaland]
I be gettin in girls clothes, make 'em buy my whole wardrobe
Better get all my dough, pluckin the hair in my nose
It's official I'm a pimp, cause my name glows
If (?) I'm back to the Yugos

[Missy]
Talkin that junk, you get BURRIED
You don't wanna end up in the cemeTARRRRY
Me and Timbaland got tracks that will KILL YOU
Any other hen I got gats that will PEEL YOU
Whatcha gon' say, RRR, whatcha gon' do, RRR
When I'm in the club, RRR, comin for you
I'm just a smooth motherfucker (aww yeah baby)
(Y'all heard me?!) Ahhh
Whatcha gon' say, RRR, whatcha gon' do, RRR
When I'm in the club, RRR, and comin for you
I'm just a smooth motherfucker

[Chorus]
