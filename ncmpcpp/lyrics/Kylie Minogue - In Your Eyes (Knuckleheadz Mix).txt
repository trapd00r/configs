What on earth am I meant to do
In this crowded place there is only you
Was gonna leave now I have to stay
You have taken my breath away

Ooh, is the world still spinning around
(Spinning around)
Ooh, I don't feel like coming down

It's in your eyes
I can tell what you're thinking
My heart is sinking too
It's no surprise
I've been watching you lately
I want to make it with you

Destiny has a funny way
When it comes and takes all your cares away
I can't think of a single thing
Other than what a beautiful state I'm in

Ooh, is the world still spinning around
(Spinning around)
Ooh, I don't feel like coming down

It's in your eyes
I can tell what you're thinking
My heart is sinking too
It's no surprise
I've been watching you lately
I want to make it with you

Want to make it with you

Ooh, is the world still spinning around
(Spinning around)
Ooh, I don't feel like coming down

It's in your eyes
I can tell what you're thinking
My heart is sinking too
It's no surprise
I've been watching you lately
I want to make it with you
(Wanna make it with you)

It's in your eyes
I can tell what you're thinking
My heart is sinking too
(My heart is sinking too)
It's no surprise
I've been watching you lately
I want to make it with you
(Wanna make it with you)

It's in your eyes
I can tell what you're thinking
My heart is sinking too
It's no surprise
(No surprise, no surprise)
I've been watching you lately
I want to make it with you

It's in your eyes
