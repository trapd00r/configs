Send "Hall of Fame" Ringtone to your Cell Yea, it's the Baldhead SLick ya heard, aka
dog ruizi, my man Solar on the track. I'm about
to hit one out the park baby. Peep this

[Chorus]
You need to put me in the hall of fame
I'm worldwide, a legend in this game. Check the resume
You could put me in the hall of fame
I'm worldwide, a legend in this, Check the resume [x2]

[Verse 1]
Peep my groundwork, check how it's masterfully laid
Composition when written gets classically made
Start with a concept then collect the beat
Sit and write the bomb shit and rep the streets
Respect my state of mind, I never waste a line
Suckers are featherweight, while I'm heavyweight with mine
I caught more war scars than others profess to
Don't ask me to kick no rap, ask me to bless you
It's special, just like a brand new three-eighty
Have you thrash your CD, 'cause man you're fugazy
Or you could catch me with the gods building
You can catch me on the mic, spitting juice to all the god's children
If I sold out, I could've sold millions
But in a minute, I'm about to hold billions
'Cause after the charade, and after the parade
Niggaz got to pay homage, to the master of this trade

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2]
My lineage is large, my pilgreamage was hard
But I held down my square, my images of God
I hit the corner like I'm real familiar
I get up on ya like a wise guy will be familiar
And all the haters want to throw me off, bitches want to blow me of
Got die-hard fans, like I'm holy cross
See I'ma put you in your place
Niggaz be shook when they see a crook With triggers in their face
The triple OG's is back in his rest
Scheming on the way, to kill a demon is his quest
I'm planning all the way, got cannons all the way
Got a boat load of artillery, landing on the bay
I never really cared about critical acclaim
Still I never let a punk, try to ridicule my name
And after all the hatin' and all of the debatin'
Niggaz will run to the stage, to see the master conversatin'

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3]
I'm like a one-man army, You little bums can't harm me
And don't try to send no little holocs to charm me
The hall of famer with my microphone flamer
The baller trainer with my monotone banger
I travel light years mentally
Essentially I'm wise, as if I've been here for centuries
And after the charade, and after the parade
Niggaz got to pay homage, to the master of this trade

[Chorus x2]
