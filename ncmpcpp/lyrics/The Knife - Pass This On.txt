I'm in love with your brother
What's his name?
I thought I'd come by 
to see him again
when you two dance   
oh what a dance
when you two laughed
oh what a laugh

does he mention my age, love?
or is he more in to young girls with dyed black hair

I'm in love with your brother 
I'd thought I'd come by

I'm in love with your brother
Yes I am 
But maybe I 
shouldn't ask for his name 
and you dance
oh what a dance
And you laughed
oh what a laugh

Does he know what I do and
you'll pass this on, won't you and?
If I asked him once what would he say 
Is he willing,
can he play?

He wasn't really looking for some more than
some company on the dancefloor and
Does he know what I do and 
you'll pass this on, won't you and?

Does he know what I do and,
you'll pass this on, won't you?
And if I ask him once,
what would he say?
is he willing, can he play?
