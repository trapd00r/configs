All the love in the world couldn't save you
All the innocence inside
You know I tried so hard to make you
To make you change your mind

And it hurts too much to see you
And how you left yourself behind
You know I didn't want to meet you
Now there's a hell I can't describe

So now I wander through my day
Trying to find my way
Still these feelings that I felt
I said to you and no one else

And no it's not going to change
I know it's gone, still I'm used
And that's nice to hang on someone
A change that's bittersweet

That's called the blues

Don't know just what I should do
Everywhere I go I see you
You know it's what you planned, this much is true
What I thought was beautiful don't live inside of you, anymore

I don't know just what I should do
Everywhere I go I see you
You know it's what we planned, this much is true
What I thought was beautiful don't live inside of you, anymore

What this means to me
The more I know you believe
What I thought was you now
Has got more that it changed on you

What I thought was true
The more that I might know is you
What I thought was you
Is only memories, distant
