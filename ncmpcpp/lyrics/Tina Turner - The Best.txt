I call you
When I need you
My heart's on fire
You come to me
Come to me
Wild and wired
Oh, you come to me
Give me everything I need

You bring a lifetime of promises
And a world of dreams
You speak the language of love
Like you know what it means
And it can't be wrong
Take my heart and make it strong

You're simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I ever met

I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Oh, tear us apart baby
Baby, I would rather be dead

In your heart I see
The start of every night and every day
In your eyes I get lost
I get washed away
Just as long as I'm here in your arms
I could be in no better place

You're simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I ever met

Ooh, I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Oh, tear us apart, no, no
Baby, I would rather be dead

Each time you leave me
I start losing control
You're walking away
With my heart and my soul
I can feel it even when I'm alone
Oh baby, don't let go

You're simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I ever met

Ooh, I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Oh, tear us apart, no, no
Baby, I would rather be dead

You're the best
