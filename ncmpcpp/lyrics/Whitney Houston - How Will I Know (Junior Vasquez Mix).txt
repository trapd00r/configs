There's a boy I know - he's the one I dream of;
Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above... Mm-hmm...
Ooh, I lose control, can't seem to get enough - uh-huh;
When I wake from dreaming, tell me, is it really love?

Hoo... How will I know? (Don't trust your feelings...)
How will I know?
How will I know? (Love can be deceiving...)
How will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat...
I fall in love whenever we meet;
I'm asking you, 'cause you know about these things...

How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy... (Can't speak...)
Falling in love is so bittersweet;
This love is strong - why do I feel weak?

Oh, wake me! I'm shaking - Wish I had you near me now, uh-huh;
Said there's no mistaking what I feel is really love...

Ooh, tell me how will I know? (Don't trust your feelings...)
How will I know?
How will I know? (Love can be deceiving...)
How will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat...
I fall in love whenever we meet;
I'm asking you, 'cause you know about these things...

How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy... (Can't speak...)
Falling in love is so bittersweet;
This love is strong - why do I feel weak?

If he loves me...
If he loves me not...
If he loves me... 
If he loves me not...
If he loves me... 
If he loves me not...

Oh, how will I know? Ooh, how will I know?
How will I know? Hey, how will I know?
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat...
I fall in love whenever we meet;
I'm asking you, 'cause you know about these things!

How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy... (Can't speak...)
Falling in love is so bittersweet;
This love is strong - why do I feel weak?

How will I know? (How will I know?) How will I know?
How will I know? (I say a prayer...) How will I know?
Hoo, how will I know? (I fall in love...) How will I know?
Hey, how will I know? (I'm asking you...) How will I, how will I...
