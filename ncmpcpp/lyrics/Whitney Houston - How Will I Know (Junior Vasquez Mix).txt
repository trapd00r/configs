There's a boy I know
He's the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes
Takes me to the clouds above
Oh, I lose control
Can't seem to get enough
When I wake from dreaming
Tell me, is it really love?

How will I know? (Girl trust your feelings)
How will I know?
How will I know? (Love can be deceiving)
How will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heart beat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone but I'm too shy; can't speak
Falling in love is so bitter sweet
This love is strong; why do I feel weak?

Oh, wake me, I'm shaking
Wish I had you near me now
Said there's no mistaking
What I feel is really love

Ooh, tell me, how will I know? (Girl, trust your feelings)
How will I know?
How will I know? (Love can be deceiving)
How will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heart beat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone but I'm too shy; can't speak
Falling in love is so bitter sweet
This love is strong; why do I feel weak?

If he loves me, if he loves me not
He loves me, if he loves me not
He loves me, if he loves me not
Oh, how will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heart beat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone but I'm too shy; can't speak
Falling in love is so bitter sweet
This love is strong; why do I feel weak?
