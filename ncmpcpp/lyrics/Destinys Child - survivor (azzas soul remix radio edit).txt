Now I let you out of my life
I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without you
But I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without you
But I'm richer
You thought that I'd be sad without you
I laugh harder
You thought I wouldn't grow without you
Now I'm wiser
Though that I'd be helpless without you
But I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without you
But I'm chillin'
You thought I wouldn't sell without you
Sold 9 million

I'm a survivor
I'm not gon give up
I'm not gon stop 
I'm gon work harder
I'm a survivor 
I'm gonna make it 
I will survive 
Keep on survivin' 

I'm a survivor 
I'm not gon give up 
I'm not gon stop 
I'm gon work harder 
I'm a survivor 
I'm gonna make it
I will survive 
Keep on survivin' 

Thought I couldn't breathe without you
I'm inhaling
You thought I couldn't see without you
Perfect vision
You thought I couldn't last without you
But I'm lastin'
You thought that I would die without you
But I'm livin'
Thought that I would fail without you
But I'm on top
Thought it would be over by now
But it won't stop
Thought that I would self destruct
But I'm still here
Even in my years to come
I'm still gon be here

I'm a survivor 
I'm not gon give up 
I'm not gon stop 
I'm gon work harder 
I'm a survivor 
I'm gonna make it 
I will survive 
Keep on survivin' 

I'm a survivor 
I'm not gon give up 
I'm not gon stop 
I'm gon work harder
I'm a survivor 
I'm gonna make it 
I will survive 
Keep on survivin' 

I'm wishin' you the best
Pray that you are blessed
Much success, no stress, and lots of happiness
(I'm better than that)
I'm not gon blast you on the radio
(I'm better than that)
I'm not gon lie on you and your family, yo
(I'm better than that)
I'm not gon hate on you in the magazines
('m better than that)
I'm not gon compromise my Christianity
(I'm better than that)
You know I'm not gon dis you on the internet
Cause my mama taught me better than that

I'm a survivor 
I'm not gon give up 
I'm not gon stop 
I'm gonna work harder 
I'm a survivor 
I'm gonna make it 
I will survive 
Keep on survivin' 

I'm a survivor 
I'm not gon give up 
I'm not gon stop 
I'm gonna work harder 
I'm a survivor 
I'm gonna make it 
I will survive 
Keep on survivin' 

After of all of the darkness and sadness
Soon comes happiness
If I surround my self with positive things
I'll gain prosperity

I'm a survivor 
I'm not gon give up 
I'm not gon stop 
I'm gon work harder 
I'm a survivor 
I'm gonna make it 
I will survive 
Keep on survivin'
