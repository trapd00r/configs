(Intro: Tupac)
Maybe its the thug in me
Maybe its the thug in me
Maybe its the thug in me
Maybe its the thug in me
Maybe its the thug in me

(Verse 1: 2Pac)
Ever since I was a young scrub
I was a thug on the corner with my niggaz slangin drugs
I'm runnin from the narcs when they pass by dont ask why
I'm a hustler till my ass die
Even if I do come up I be ready when they run up, huh
I'll be a nut to put my gun up, huh
I never trust these hoes at all, fucking with them tramp ass sluts who Suppose to fall
Since she played you for you money but the shit was cool
Guess its true niggaz be bitches too
You cant see how she worked you, all up in her skirt
Now you looking like a jerk, cause she hurt you
Now heads up dont be a playa hater
Just peep game keep your mind on your money watch the bitch change
See hoes love thugs, and thugs love loot
Hand it over motherfucker before I shoot
Who do u love

(Chorus (x2): 2Pac)
Maybe it's the thug in me
Maybe it's the thug in me
Tell me, Who do you love?

Maybe its the thug in me
Maybe its the thug in me
Who do you love?

(Verse 2: 2Pac)
Im livin that
Thug life baby, steady smoking endo going crazy
Baby come and hug me when you rub me, turn the lights down
We in the dark do you love me
Everyboy is talking bout they know me
But they aint down like my motherfucking homies
Tell me what you need when you see me
And we can get it on biatch take it easy
Don't try to hold me, control me
But you can take my number, baby call me when you lonely
Cause its a mans world, aint no need to ask why
I'm high till I die, and strapped with my 4-5
Cause you can loose it in the gutter
I wonder if I die by the hands of another broke motherfucker
They call me the alcoholer I'm all in, thug 4 life nigga ballin
I'm gettin tired of these hoes tryna play me
You can't fade me, me and my niggaz going crazy
All day long Im straight thuggin, and contantly mean muggin
Breakin the bitches that be buggin, tell me who do you love

(Chorus (x2): 2Pac)
Maybe it's the thug in me
Maybe it's the thug in me
Tell me, Who do you love?

Maybe its the thug in me
Maybe its the thug in me
Who do you love?
