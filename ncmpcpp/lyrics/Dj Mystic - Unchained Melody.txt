Oh, my love, my darling 
I've hungered for your touch 
A long, lonely time 
And time goes by so slowly 
And time can do so much 
Are you still mine? 
I need your love, I need your love 
God speed your love to me 

Lonely rivers flow 
To the sea, to the sea 
To the open arms of the sea 
Lonely rivers sigh 
"Wait for me, wait for me" 
I'll be coming home; wait for me 

Oh, my love, my darling 
I've hungered, hungered for your touch 
A long, lonely time 
And time goes by so slowly 
And time can do so much 
Are you still mine? 
I need your love, I need your love 
God speed your love to me
