Verse 1
   
   [Scratch: Telephone ringing]
   
   "Who's this? Juanita? Fatima? Solika? Oh, it's Freda?
   Look, I have a question, just what is it that you need
   A man, a lover, maybe someone to talk to?
   Or could it be you're schemin'? Oh, not you!
   Well listen, I got this phone installed for business
   And who gave you our number? Seriously, what is this?
   The new fad? Now you wanna kick it to a rapper,
   DJ or dancer? Well I don't have the
   Time for no stunts, no hookers and no games
   Our name and our fame is for the long way we came
   The struggle, the hassle, the hustle, the fight
   And you're asking me if you can see me tonight?
   Don't you know the Guru's not the type to be out skeezin'
   The reason is because I do believe in
   Havin' the right to choose the one I want
   And, if I had a girl, why would I front?
   You're only gonna get your feelings hurt, miss
   And truthfully I really don't wanna have to diss
   My music means everything to me, it's my life
   So make like a camper, and go take a hike
   You can't mess with my mind, and don't tie up my line
   You called yesterday, so what you want this time?"
   
   Verse 2
   
   "A-yo Premier (Yeah?) Who's that knockin' at the door?
   (Yo man, it's Vicky) Vicky? Are you sure?
   The one from down the block who was actin' all hot
   She stops me all the time and says she likes me a lot?
   How does she know where we live, I didn't tell her
   And word is bond, duke, I'm not the fella
   No matter what I say this young lady's persistent
   For instance, she watches me from a distance
   And if I walk by and I forget to say hi
   She pushes up on me and rubs me with her thigh
   I told her I was taken, but she doesn't care
   A-yo, do me a favour, tell her I'm not here
   Forget it, I think she heard my voice already
   You can let her in, but I'm tryna cook spaghetti
   Oh, hello, how you doin'? Who me? I'm fine
   I don't mean to be rude, but...what you want this time?"
