Ooh...

I know it's been sometime
I've had something on my mind
You see I haven't been the same
Since that cold November day

We said we needed space
But all we found was an empty place
And the only things I've learned
Is that I need you desperately
So here I am, and can you please tell me, oh?

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home?
Back to the open arms of a love that's waiting there
And if somebody loves you

Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care for me
Ooh...

I've been around enough to know
That dreams don't turn to gold
And that there is no easy way
No, you just can't run away

And what we had was so much more
Than we ever had before
And no matter how I try
You're always on my mind
So here I am, and can you please tell me, oh?

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home?
Back to the open arms of a love that's waiting there
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care for me

Now that I am here with you
I'll never let you go
I look into your eyes
And now I know, now I know, oh

Where do broken... hearts go?
Can they find their way home?
Back to the open arms of a love that's waiting there
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home?
Back to the open arms of a love that's waiting there
And if somebody loves you

Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care for me
For me...
You still care
For me
