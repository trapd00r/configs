Do da n de da n dai
(do da n de da n dai)
It's a feeling I got inside
Tell me just why oh why
Do da n de da n dai

Sky is blue and the day is light
I look to the sun
I see your face and your smile is bright
The clouds are on the run

You ask me why I look so sad
But I find the words to say

Do da n de da n dai
(do da n de da n dai)
It's a feeling I got inside


Tell me just why oh why
Do da n de da n dai

You're getting close and I kiss your lips
It never felt so strange
I feel your soul on a different trip
It's time to rearrange

You ask me where all the love is gone
But I find the words to say

Do da n de da n dai
(do da n de da n dai)
It's a feeling I got inside
Tell me just why oh why
Do da n de da n dai
