I used to be your girlfriend and I know I did it well
Oh, yes, you know it's true
You'd call me Cinderella
All you had to do is yell
And I'd be there for you

Here I am
So try to forgive me
I don't believe in fairy tales
Here we are
With nothing but honesty
I've had enough
I'm not gonna stay

I'm sorry for running away like this
And I'm sorry
I've already made my wish
Ah, but Cinderella's got to go

From time to time I'd try to tell just what was on my mind.
You told  me not today
Come back, do that 
Where's Cinderella at was all you had to say

Here I am
So try to forgive me
I don't believe in fairy tales
Here we are
with nothing but honesty
I've had enough
I'm not gonna stay

I'm sorry for running away like this
And I'm sorry I've already made my wish
Ah, but Cinderella's got to go

I'm sorry, just trying to live my life
Don't worry you're gonna be alright
But Cinderella's got to go

(whisper)
I used to say I want you
You cast me in your spell
I did everything you wanted me to...but now I shall

Break free from all your lies
I won't be blind, you see
My love, it can't be sacrificed
I won't return to thee

I'm so sorry
I've already made up my mind
I won't return to be

I'm sorry to say, I'm running away now
Don't worry, you will be alright
I'm running away
I've made up my mind now
You're gonna have to let me go
She's gotta gooooo!!

I'm sorry for running away like this
And I'm sorry
I've already made my wish
Ah, But Cinderella's got to go
I'm sorry, just trying to live my life
Don't worry you're gonna be alright
But Cinderella's got to go
