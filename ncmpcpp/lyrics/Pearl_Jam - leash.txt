Troubled souls unite, we got ourselves tonight.
I am fuel, you are friends, we got the means to make amends.
I am lost, I'm no guide, but I'm by your side.
I am right by your side.

Young lover, I stand.
It was their idea, I proved to be a man.
Take my fucking hand.
It was their idea, I proved to be a man.
Will myself to find a home, a home within myself.
We will find a way, we will find our place.

Drop the leash, drop the leash...
Get outta' my fuckin' face.
Drop the leash, drop the leash...
Get outta' my fuckin' face.
Drop the leash, drop the leash
Get outta' my fucking face.

Drop the leash, we are young.
Drop the leash, drop the leash.
Oh, get outta' my fuckin' face...
Drop the leash, drop the leash...
Get outta' my, my...

Delight, delight, delight in our youth...
Get outta' my fuckin' face...
