Can you handle this 
Michelle 
Can you handle this 
Beyonce
Can you handle this 
I don't think they can handle this whoooo 

Better move 
Cause we've arrived 
Lookin' sexy
Lookin' fly 
Baddest chick
Chick inside 
Dj 
Jam tonight 
Spotted me 
A tender thang 
There you are
Come on baby 
Don't you wanna 
Dance with me 
Can you handle 
Handle me 

You gotta do much better 
If you're gonna dance with me tonight 
You gotta work your jelly 
If you're gonna dance with me tonight 
Read my lips carefully, if you like what you see 
Move, groove, prove you can hang with me 
By the looks I got you shook up and scared of me 
Buckle your seatbelt, it's time for takeoff 

I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly 
I don't think you're ready for this 
'cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe 

I don't think you're ready for this jelly 
I don't think you're ready for this jelly 
I don't think you're ready for this 
'cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe 

Baby can you handle this 
Baby can you handle this 
Baby can you handle this 
I don't think you can handle this 

I'm about to break you off 
H-town goin hard 
Read my hips 
Slap my thighs 
Swing my hair 
Squint my eyes 
Lookin' hot 
Smellin' good 
Groovin' like 
I'm from the hood 
Over my shoulder 
I blow you a kiss 
Can you handle
Handle this 

I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly 
I don't think you're ready for this 
'cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe 

I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this 
'cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe 

Move your body up and down (whoo) 
Make your booty touch the ground (whoo) 
I can't help but wonder why 
My vibe's too vibealacious for you babe 

I shake my jelly at every chance 
When I whip with my hips you slip into a trance 
I'm hoping you can handle all this jelly that I have 
Now let's cut a rug while we scat some jazz 

scatting 

I don't think you're ready for this jelly 
I don't think you're ready for this jelly 
I don't think you're ready for this 
'cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe
