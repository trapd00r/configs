*Royce talking*
D-12, worst fucking rap group ever (You ready?)
Royce Da 5'9" would like to apologize to the family of my homeboy Bugz
for lettin' that line leak out the radio, it was a long story how it happened
D-12 though, y'all better quit actin' like that wadn't my man too
Like I was tryna disrespect him or somethin', I was tryna disrespect y'all
'Cause that's what I'm doin' (gun-cocking) from here on in
My new name from now on, don't even call me Royce Da 5'9" no mo'
Call me Malcolm X, 'cause e'rybody in the city wanna kill me (*gun shooting sounds*)
I'm Malcolm X now hahahahaha, we gon' see who goin, I ain't goin nowhere motherfucker
We gon' see, e'rybody who against me, nigga I'm mad (BITCH)
Haha, yeah, there's only one problem
Everytime you motherfuckers breathe on the mic
It's a motherfuckin' lie nigga, nobody believes you (*echoes*)

[Chorus]
We gon' beat yo' ass DOWN (2x)

Y'all niggaz sound like y'all write y'all rhymes with motherfuckin' crayons, BITCHES

*Royce rapping*

Yeah, what rap crew I gotta snatch up out the game (bitch)
Who must I smack for sayin my name?
Somebody gon' die, it's probably YOU
You couldn't fit Bizarre's body in my shoes
Niggaz quick to talk, all hood 'til I pop up
Plus, you just act tough cause Suge got locked up
I am above y'all, when you droppin your raps to diss me
I only recognize the top of your hats
And I don't like Proof, punk-ass, he think he tough
He keep thirty niggaz with him, cause he weak as fuck!
I ever catch you by yourself, I'ma fuck you up
Snatch your little cheap-ass chain and piece you up
You better hope you and the white boy keep in touch
And be a good little hype man, or your lease is up
Since Slim signed 50, I don't see your teeth as much
That's good, cause you got a grill like a fuckin truck!
DAMN HOMIE, it's history, over, hang it up
Go somewhere and hang up some 50 posters, PUNK
You speak too late, y'all prolly gon' go up to them awards
and get yo' ass whooped by B2K
I just wish Eminem would stop tellin' everybody he ain't speakin' to me
Like I'm one of his hoes or somethin'
How 'bout this, I ain't speakin to you, chump
And I'ma keep pickin on your weak ass crew
You, BITCH, Bizarre you a fat stutterin fuck
You a joke, I choke whoever buttered you up
I've been ridin by your house, you don't come out too much
You hidin, when I find you I'ma snatch you out of that truck
and tie your fat stankin ass to your couch and just
FEED YOU, you already look like you about to bust
Nigga you can run or hide; I'll be on your porch
with a cheeseburger tryin to lure you outside!
'Cause he's in it, Bizarre say G-g-g-g-g-g-unit
I bet you throw some extra "g's" in it
Just like a stutterin' fool, can't reach intelligence
He sweats when he raps, cuz he got a speach impediment
You, BITCH, Porky's pig and Porky's tomb
About to dig his own grave with a fork and spoon
You, BITCH, Denaun and Swifty please
Give it a year,both y'all be wreckin' 50's lease
What do I know, that other nigga y'all got in your group
I don't even know his name, but he can shovel my snow
You, BITCH, let's face it I gave it to y'all
My lil' sister got six puppies that's braver than y'all (puppies barking)
Niggaz is startin' the beef I'm 'bout to end with the quickness
I'm 'bout to end this quicker than Bizarre can finish a biscuit
Quicker than quick shit, y'all ain't felt the half
Quicker than Eminem can pinch Elton's ass
Don't call me, I ain't ready to squash ya yet, kiss my ASS
I don't wanna talk to ex, I am so sick I should be compared to cancer
Y'all throw up ya dukes and don't swing like Fred G. Sanford
I be makin' muh'fuckers scratch they heads when I rhyme
Y'all lil' niggaz crack ya heads then rhyme, go play;
you lil punk ass niggaz, y'all can scream and yell all you want
I feel like I'm battlin' Kenan & Kel
You, BITCH, none o' y'all can put in the card to kill
Paul better call me, like he called Benzino
Matter of fact, I might even do a song with Ray
Sign with Murder Inc. and hit you with a song-a-day

[Chorus]
We gon' beat yo' ass DOWN (4x)

*Royce talking*
I don't even want you lil' punks to think I'm mad
Y'all lil' niggaz are Ninja Turtles, you're nothing
Nothin', you not on my level, I will beat yo bosses ass, nigga
Tre Little, bring it on

*Tre Little rapping*
Tre Little, the baby gorrilla, I'm just that guy
I'm 5'6", got stacked lines, shit that high, I'm ridin'
FUCK you and your commercial appeal
I turn yo' head into blue 'n yellow Purple Hills
I bet you whatever that nobody beats my family
Eminem, Nelly said that he'll eat you like candy
What did you do, got on the phone and called him up
You don't wanna talk to Royce, but you talk to us
You, BITCH, yo' crew some local hoes
I'll hit you harder than that white girl that broke your nose
You and Royce can squash this with one talk
Step around from your security and talk to that man
I understand you backin' yo' crew, but diss my brother
Anythin' that happen to him, somethin' gonna happen to you
And I don't give a fuck for that, nigga, I'll do life
I advise you to stop; yo' money don't buy you stripes
Only thing that money brings is fake niggaz and problems
Followed by niggaz who hate fake niggaz and rob 'em
But you niggaz is WACK; Denaun I'ma stab you
So many times, I'ma feel bad when you collapse!
You niggaz is so BITCH you make me sick to my stomach
Every beat that you ever made sound like it was missin' somethin'
Timbaland lookin' ass, nigga, my style is realer
What producer you ever know only good for album filler
We gon' beat yo' ass DOWN (2x)

*Royce talking*
You!, Yea, punk ass niggaz, yea we in the streets now too, nigga
Big Homie's out nigga, what up

*Tre Little talking*
Yea you studderin ass motherfuckers, what y'all thought
My brother here ain't have no backbone?
Nigga, it's on when I see y'all
Proof what the fuck you thinkin' of nigga, that's cash boy
Need the white boy to get y'all started ass niggaz
Fuck y'all hoes, I told Royce I ain't like that motherfucka
Faggots, I smack the shit outta any one o' y'all niggaz
Sell my bill one nigga
What the fuck y'all thought nigga y'all'll get bought bitch
Street orientated; y'all motherfuckers hate it
Learn how to flow stop bein' mad y'all bitches
Trick, trick, when I catch yo' bitch ass, yeah dude
Asked about cash nigga, you comin' to yo' doom
You'll end up like click boom, bitch
Rock City motherfucker, regardless
Get the point bitch, or get the hollows motherfucker
It's Cash Flow, bitch, Big Homie
