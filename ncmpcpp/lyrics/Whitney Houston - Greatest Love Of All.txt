I believe the children are our are future 
Teach them well and let them lead the way 
Show them all the beauty they possess inside 
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be 
Everybody searching for a hero 
People need someone to look up to 
I never found anyone to fulfill my needs 
A lonely place to be 
So I learned to depend on me 

[Chorus:]
I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadows 
If I fail, if I succeed 
At least I live as I believe 
No matter what they take from me 
They can't take away my dignity 
Because the greatest love of all 
Is happening to me 
I found the greatest love of all 
Inside of me 
The greatest love of all 
Is easy to achieve 
Learning to love yourself 
It is the greatest love of all 

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way 
Show them all the beauty they possess inside 
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier 
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be 

[Chorus]

And if by chance, that special place 
That you've been dreaming of 
Leads you to a lonely place 
Find your strength in love
