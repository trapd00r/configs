Like a movie scene
In the sweetest dreams
Have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
On my fingertips
I have to say is even better
Then I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness
The tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life

CHORUS: 
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh 
I've dreamed of this love for so long 
Waiting for tonight 
Tender words you say
Take my breath away
Love me now, leave me never
Found a sacred place
Lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning 
Emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

CHORUS (2x)

Gone are the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning
Emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

CHORUS
