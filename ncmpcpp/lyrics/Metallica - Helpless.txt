I gotta see you moving fast
See you come my way
See the dreams, I hope they last
Never fade away.

Gotta see the lights above
Make it loud tonight
Gotta set it all a-fire
Set it all a-light

See the flashing lights
Hear the thunder roar
I am gonna set you all a-light
Gotta make it man
I ain't got a choice
Gotta fill this hall tonight

Helpless
Helpless
Helpless
Helpless

I don't know what I'm gonna do
Maybe not tonight
Gotta set you all a-fire
Gotta treat you right.

I can see the flashing lights
Lit before your love
Gotta hear the thunder roar
Coming from above.

See the flashing lights
Hear the thunder roar
I'm gonna set you all a-light
Gotta make it man
I ain't got a choice
Gotta fill this hall tonight

Helpless
Helpless
Helpless
Helpless

I can see the stars
But, I can't see what's going on
Every night alone
I sing my song just for fun.

Only time will tell
If I'll make it myself someday
This stage is mine
Music is my destiny.

Cannot squeeze the life from me!
