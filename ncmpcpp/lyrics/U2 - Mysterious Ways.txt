Send "Mysterious Ways" Ringtone to your Cell Johnny take a walk
With your sister the moon
Let her pale light in
To fill up your room
You've been living underground
Eating from a can
You've been running away
From what you don't understand
Love

She's slippy
You're sliding down
She'll be there
When you hit the ground

It's alright...it's alright...it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways
It's alright...it's alright...it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways

Johnny take a dive
With your sister in the rain
Let her talk about the things
You can't explain
To touch is to heal
To hurt is to steal
If you want to kiss the sky
Better learn how to kneel (on your knees boy!)

She's the wave
She turns the tide
She sees the man inside the child

It's alright...it's alright...it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways
It's alright...it's alright...it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways
It's alright...it's alright...it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways
It's alright...it's alright...it's alright
Lift my days...light up my nights

One day you'll look back
And you'll see
Where
You were held how
By this love
While
You could stand
There
And not move on this moment
Follow this feeling

It's alright...it's alright...it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways
It's alright...it's alright...it's alright
We move through miracle days
Spirit moves in mysterious ways
She moves with it
She moves with it
Lift my days and light up my nights
Love
