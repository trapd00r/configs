[Violent J]
In my mind's eye 
You throw wickedness at me 
I'm just a toy to you 
I bring no real joy to you 
The way I see it 
You don't want me here no more 
You want a hole in my forehead 
And blood pouring on the floor 
Cause I'm so dirty 
Fuckin' dirty and shoddy 
I want up out of this body 
That's hated by everybody 
Sometimes I don't know why 
I continue to try 
It's so much easier to die 
Than to get by 
And to get by 
And to get by 

[Violent J]
If I'm gonna die 
I'm taking you with me 
Get you and get me 
We can be bloody 
If I'm gonna fly 
I'm gonna succeed 
Take you and get me 
We can be bloody 
Sometimes I don't know why 
I continue to try 
It's so much easier to die 
Than to get by 
And to get by 
And to get by 

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
I don't wanna leave my house 
Don't wanna open my mouth 
Don't wanna read my mail 
Don't wanna meet with pals 
I don't wanna fuck shit up 
Don't wanna fuckin' get up 
Don't wanna take up space 
Don't want your time to waste 
I don't wanna fight this back 
Just wanna fade to black 
Don't wanna turn to faith 
Or wanna burn at stakes 
I don't wanna build my life 
I wanna bloody my knife 
Don't wanna grab the phone 
Don't wanna leave this room 
I don't wanna talk with you 
I'm fuckin' stalkin' you 
Don't wanna fix myself 
I wanna nix myself 
I don't wanna try to change 
Just wanna fry my brains 
Don't wanna slow shit down 
I wanna throw shit around 
I don't wanna run nowhere 
Don't want no one to care 
Don't want another crack at it 
I'd rather be a crack addict 
I don't wanna look for help 
Don't wanna help myself 
I don't wanna even try 
To get by... 
To get by... 

And to get by...and to get by...and to get by...and to get by...
