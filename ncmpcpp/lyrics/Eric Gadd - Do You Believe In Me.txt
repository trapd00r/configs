Send "Do You Believe in Me" Ringtone to your Cell She was workin' everyday down the street 
Selling flowers 
Pretending she was blind 
So I said, "Won't you please believe me 
Instead of running 'round and 
Laughing all the time?" 
She was five foot four and lonely 
As she walked into my room, 
"So this is where you stay" 
But when I tried to tell her 
About these lonely walls 
There was nothing 
I could say 
Do you believe in me 
I'm yours you're mine 
And though you refuse to see 
I'll be behind 
Anyday & anyway another rain had to come 
And it got to me as well, well, well 
When your losing what you came for 
In the first place it gets fogged 
Believe me, I can tell, I can tell 
So I slip into my lonely room 
And saying to myself 
It doesn't matter if I fall 
But then I heard some noises at my door and far away 
There was somebody, somebody who shouted 
Do you believe in me 
I'm yours, you're mine 
And though you refuse to see 
I'll be behind 
Do you believe in me 
I'm yours, you're mine 
And though you refuse to see 
I'll be behind 
Do you want to (?) (do you want today) 
I'll be hearing you someday say 
Do you want my love 
Do you want my love
