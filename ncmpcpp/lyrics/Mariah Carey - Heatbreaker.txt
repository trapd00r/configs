[Jay-Z:]
Yeah
Aight
([MC:] We're gonna do it like this)
Let's go
Jigga

[MC:]
(Gimme your love, gimme your love)
(Gimme your love, gimme your love)

[Jay-Z:]
Aight
You gotta bounce to this like this
You almost kinda watching this
Aha, whooo
Escape

[MC:]
Boy your love's so good
I don't wanna let go
And although I should
I can't leave you alone
Cause you're so disarming
I'm caught up in the midst of you
And I cannot resist at all
Boy if I do
The things you wanna to
The way I used to do
Could you love me baby
You leave me feelin used
Cause you go and break my heart

Heartbreaker you've got the best of me
But I just keep on comin' back incessantly
Oh why did you have to run your game on me
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart
(Gimme your love, gimme your love)
(Gimme your love, gimme your love)

It's a shame to be
So euphoric and weak
When you smile at me
And you tell me things
That you know persuade me
To relinquish my love to you
But I cannot resist
At all
Boy if I do
The things you wanna to
The way I used to do
Would you love me baby
You leave me feelin used
Cause you go and break my heart

Heartbreaker you've got the best of me
But I just keep on comin' back incessantly
Oh why did you have to run your game on me
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

[Jay-Z:]
She wanna shop with Jay
Play box with Jay
She wanna pillowfight in the middle 
What a night
She wanna drive my benz 
With 5 of her friends
She wanna creep past the block
Spyin' again
She wanna roll with Jay
Chase skeeos away
She wanna fight with lame chicks
Blow my day
She wanna expect the rest
Kick me to the curb
If she find one strand of hair
Longer than hers 
She want love in the Jacuzzi
Rub up in the movies 
Access to the old crib
Keys to the newbie
She wanna answer the phone
Tattoo her arm
That's when I gotta send her back to
Her mom
She called me heartbreaker
When we apart it makes her
Wanna piece of paper
Scribble down "I hate ya"
When she know she love Jay because
She love everything Jay say, Jay does
And uhh

[MC:]
