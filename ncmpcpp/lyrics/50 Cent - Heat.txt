(Skit) 
"Aye you want some of this shit" 
"Naw, I don't want that shit" 
"I don't give a fuck, I don't play dat shit" 
"And I'm fin'nin to buss a cap on the nigga" 
"Man SHUT the fuck up" 
"Slow down, slow down, slow down" 
"You see that brick house right there" 
"That's the nigga crib when he come out you gotta tighten his ass up" 
"I'ma get in the other car" 
"Aight" (a car revs up) 
(gunshots) 

(Chorus: 50 Cent) 
If there's beef, cock it and dump it, the drama really means nothin 
To me I'll ride by and blow ya brains out (brains out) 
There's no time to cock it, no way you can stop it 
When niggas run up on you wit them thangs out (thangs out) 
I do what I gotta do I don't care I if get caught 
The D.A. can play this motherfuckin tape in court 
I'll kill you - I ain't playin, hear what I'm sayin, homie I ain't playin 
Catch you slippin, I'ma kill you - I ain't playin, hear what I'm sayin, 
homie I ain't playin 

(50 Cent) 
Keep thinkin I'm candy till ya fuckin skull get popped 
And ya brain hop out the top like Jack-in-da-box (yeah!) 
In the hood summer time is the killing season 
It's hot out this bitch that's a good 'nuff reason (wooh!) 
I've seen gangsta's get religious when they start bleedin 
Sayin "Lord, Jesus Help Me" cause they ass leakin 
When that window roll down and that A.K. come out 
You can squeeze ya lil handgun until you run out 
And you can run for ya back-up 
But them machine gun shells gone tear ya back up 
God's on ya side, shit I'm aight wit that 
Cause we gonna reload them clips and come right back 
It's a fact homie, you go against me ya fucked 
I get the drop, if you can duck, ya luckier then Lady Luck 
Look nigga, don't think you safe cause you moved out the hood 
Cuz ya momma still around dog, and dat ain't good 
If you was smart you'd be shook of me 
Cuz I'd get tired of lookin for ya, spray ya momma crib, and let yo ass look 
for me 

(Chorus) 

(50 Cent) 
My heart bleeds for you nigga, I can't wait to get to you 
Behind that twinkle in yo eyes, I can see the bitch in you 
Nigga you know the streets talk 
So they'll be no white flags and no peace talks 
I got my back against the wind, I'm down to ride till the sun burn out 
If I die today, I'm happy how my life turned out 
See the shootouts that I've been in I'm by myself 
Locked up I was in a box by myself 
I done made myself a millionaire by myself 
Now, shit changed motherfucka I can hire some help 
I done heard about the 50 grand you put in the hood 
But ya shootin' fin'nin to get get shot it won't do 'em no good 
With a pistol I define the definition of pain 
If you survive ya bones'll still fuckin hurt when it rain 
Oh you a pro at playin battleship well this ain't the same 
Lil homie this is a whole different type of war game 
See the losers and up in shackles and motherfuckin chains 
Or laid out in the streets leakin' out they brains 

(Chorus) 

(50 Cent) 
After the fist fights it's gunfire boy you get the best of me (best of me) 
If you don't wanna get shot I suggest you don't go testin me (testin me) 
All the wrong I've done the Lord still keep on blessin me (blessin me) 
Fin'nin to run rap cuz Dr. Dre got the recipe (the recipe, recipe) 

Yeah, haha, aye Dre 
You got me feelin real bulletproof up in this motherfucka 
Cuz the windows on my motherfuckin Benz is bulletproof nigga 
Cuz my motherfuckin vest is bulletproof nigga 
Cuz my motherfuckin hat is bulletproof nigga 
But the Doc said if I get hit I might get a fuckin concussion 
But better that then a hole in the head right nigga, haha ha ha
