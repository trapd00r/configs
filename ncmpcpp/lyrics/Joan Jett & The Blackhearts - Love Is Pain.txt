Hey, you must obey
While you will bleed you know I need to get my way
So now, you listen up
You are my pup, I'll beat you up in every way.
And when I speak to you
You answer true or I will make you black and blue
I love to make you wait, you take the bait
I know you hate and love me too.

We are not to blame,
In seeing love is pain,
We are not ashamed
To say that love is pain!

And we'll do it again
Oww!

I know you're not afraid,
'Cause when you stayed you knew you made the final show
So now, you must submit
I'll never quit to you
Admit you'll never go.

We are not to blame,
In seeing love is pain,
We are not ashamed
To say that love is pain!

We are not ashamed
We are not ashamed
We are not ashamed
We are not ashamed
To say that love is pain
And we'll do it again
