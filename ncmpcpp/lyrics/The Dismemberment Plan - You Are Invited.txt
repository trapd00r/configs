I got it in the mail one morning 
There was no return address 
Just my name in gold leaf on the front
There was no time or location 
There was really no info at all 
No date, no place, no time, no RSVP
But it said

You are invited by anyone to do anything 
You are invited for all time

I didn't think much about it 
It seemed like a really dumb joke 
But later that week it was Friday once again
So I took it down to a disco 
That wouldn't have me in a million years 
I flashed it once and I was inside with a drink 
I really didn't stay too long there 
'Cause no one was having much fun 
I made my way to a party all the way 'cross town 
It was thrown by the friend of an ex-thing 
I wasn't sure if I should go 
But when I got up in the place there were smiles all up and down 
I grabbed my ex in the kitchen 
I told her I was sorry I came 
But she looked at me with a glazed smile and said

You are invited by anyone to do anything 
You are invited for all time
You are so needed by everyone to do everything 
You are invited for all time

I headed for home kinda early 
The party wasn't all that great 
I saw my neighbor out crying on his front porch
I stopped to see what his deal was 
I didn't catch much through the sobs 
Something about a party and he didn't go 
I thought about it for a second 
With the invite in my hands
I threw it down at his feet and I said

You are invited by anyone to do anything 
You are invited for all time
You are so needed if you really want to go 
You are invited for all time 
For all time
For all time
