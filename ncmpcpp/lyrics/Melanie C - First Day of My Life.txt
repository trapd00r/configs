So I found a reason to stay alive,
Try a little harder, see the other side.
Talking to myself -
Too many sleepless nights,
Trying to find a meaning to this stupid life.
I don't want your sympathy,
Sometimes I don't know who to be.
Hey what ya looking for?
No one has the answer -
They just want more
Hey who's gonna make it back?
This could be the first
Day of my life

So I found a reason
To let it go
Tell you that I'm smiling
But I still need to grow.

Will I find salvation in the arms of love?
Will it stop me searching? Will it be enough?

I don't want your sympathy.
Sometimes I don't know who to be.

Hey what ya looking for?
No one has the answer, you just want more
Hey who's gonna make it back?
This could be the first day of my life.

The first time to really feel alive
The first time to break the chain
The first time to walk away from pain

Hey, what ya looking for?
No one has the answer - we just want more
Hey, who's gonna make it back?
This could be the first day of your life.
Hey what ya looking for?
No one has the answer they just want more...


Hey, who's gonna shine a light?

This could be the first day of my life...
