Boy I'ma make you love me, make you want me
And I'ma give you some attention, tonight
Now follow my intuitions, what you're wishin
See I'ma keep you up all night, for a long time
Just start countin the ways

[Chorus]
Break me off, show me what you got
Cause I don't want, no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
Cause I don't want, no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
Cause I don't want, no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
Cause I don't want, no...

[Missy]

Boy it's been a long time, a crazy long time
And I don't want no minute man, and that's real
Give it to me some more

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
Yeah, uhh, uhh
It's time to set yo' clock back bout as long as you can
I stop daylight and Ludacris the maintenance man
Get your oil changed, I check fluids and transmission
You one minute FOOLS, you wonder why y'all missin
On the back of milk cartons and there's no reward
No regards, close but it's no cigar
A hard head make a soft ass, but a hard dick make the sex last
I jump in pools and make a big splash
Water overflowin, so get your head right
It's all in yo' mind punk so keep your head tight
Enough with tips and advice and thangs
I'm big dog, havin women seein stripes and thangs
They go to sleep, start snorin, countin sheep and shit
They so wet, that they body start to leak and shit
Just cause I'm an ALL-nighter, shoot ALL fire
Ludacris, balance and rotate ALL tires

[Missy]
Ooooooh, I don't want I don't need I can't stand no minute man
I don't want no minute man
Ooooooh, here's your chance be a man take my hand understand
I don't want no minute man

Break me off, show me what you got
Cause I don't want, no one minute man

Break me off, show me what you got
Cause I don't want, no one minute man

Break me off, show me what you got
Cause I don't want, no one minute man

Break-break me off, break break me off
Break break me off, show me what you got

Break me off, show me what you got...
Break me off, show me what you got...
Break me off, show me what you got...
Break me off, break break me off
