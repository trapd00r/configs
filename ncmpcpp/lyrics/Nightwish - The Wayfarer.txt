I went into the wilderness with Uncle Walt
I discovered the wild
Learning to suck all the experience
Seeing the world through cradle's bars

The wild blessed me with an errant mind
Showing the way for the ultimate lore
I went around the world, beyond the wild
Finding my home from an ocean shore

Wayfarer, heartlander
What if I only had
One more night to live

Home is where the way is
My road goes on forever
One more voyage to go

Dead to the world
Alive for the journey
