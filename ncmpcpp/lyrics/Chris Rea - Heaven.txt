I see a turning wheel
                    On a dusty track
                    Caught in the void and empty space
                    In between there and back
                    And the paradise of going somewhere
                    That's still so far away
                    Happy, boy you bet I am
                    Holding on to this smile for just as long as I can

                    Heaven

                    It's all bright in front
                    And it's all dark behind
                    Living for the now that's in between the bridges 
                    and the signs
                    And getting there is still a long long way to go
                    While the others dream a wish
                    This is everything I officially need to know
                    Happy, boy you bet I am
                    Holding on to this smile for just as long as I can

                    Heaven
