Give me time to reason,
Give me time to think it through.
Passing through the season,
Where I cheated you.

I will always have a cross to wear,
But the bolt reminds me I was there.

So give me the strength,
To face this test of mine.

If only I could turn back time,
If only I had said what I still hide.
If only I could turn back time,
I would stay for the night... for the night.

Claim your right to science,
Claim your right to see the truth
Though my pangs of conscience,
Will drill a hole in you.

I've seen it coming like a thief in the night,
I've seen it coming from the flash of your light.

So give me the strength,
to face this test of mine

If only I could turn back time,
if only I had said what I still hide
if only I could turn back time,
I would stay...

The bolt reminds me I was there
The bolt reminds me I was there

If only I could turn back time,
If only I had said what I still hide.
If only I could turn back time,
I would stay for the night.

If only I could turn back time,
If only I had said what I still hide.
If only I could turn back time,
I would stay for the night.

If only I could, (If only I could)
If only I could, (If only I could)
If only I could turn back time,
I would stay for the night.

If only I could, (If only I could)
If only I could, (If only I could)
If only I could turn back time,
I would stay for the night.
