Murda Inc
Haha it must be the ass
That got me like that
If it get any fatter
Man the rule gonna hafta get at her
And our situation won't matter
I come to make you smile
In the freakiest manners
J to the L-O
Hello, no I'm not Ley Harvery Oswald
I'm the rule in the shot call
Off the wall
Like MJ in his early days
It's the Inc. and Lopez now

[Jennifer Lopez]
Ain't it funny
It's been awhile since you came around
Now ya wanna see what's goin' down
Tryin' to tell me how ya want my time
Tryin' to tell me how I'm on your mind (on your mind)
See it never had to be this way
You should of never played the games you played
Now I'm seein' that you're kinda lame
Knowin how the situation changed

[Jennifer Lopez]
Ain't it funny
Baby that you want me, when you had me
Love is crazy, now I can smile and say
Ain't it funny
Baby that you want me, when you had me
Love is crazy, I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't it funny

[Jennifer Lopez]
I remember how you walked away
Even when I tried to call your name
See at first I didn't understand
Now you're lookin' like a lonely man (lonely man)
I remember how you did me wrong
And now you're hurtin' cuz my love is gone
Everybody gets a chance to burn
You can take it as a lesson learned

[Jennifer Lopez]
Ain't it funny
Baby that you want me, when you had me
Love is crazy, now I can smile and say
Ain't it funny
Baby that you want me, when you had me
Love is crazy, I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't it funny

[Caddillac Tah]
C-A double D, Hi
Double dose my
Fly by, red line
Touch the roast side
Oh I, never been a sucker for chill Ja
Spit the ism, hit em, get rid of em, and you know Tah
Get it gully, and ain't that funny
How they want me, see me workin' wit money
But Cali ain't a dummy
What these brodies want from me?
Cos all I got is G, J.Lo
And Murda I.N.C.

[Jennifer Lopez]
I really wish you wouldn't send me gifts
Tryin' to make me sit and reminisce
Tryin' to blind me with your bling bling
Thought I told you love don't cost a thing
(love don't cost a thing)
Hope you realize that now I'm through
And I don't ever wanna hear from you
I had enough of bein' there for you
Now I'm laughin' while you play the fool

[Jennifer Lopez]
Ain't it funny
Baby that you want me, when you had me
Love is crazy, now I can smile and say
Ain't it funny
Baby that you want me, when you had me
Love is crazy, I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't it funny
