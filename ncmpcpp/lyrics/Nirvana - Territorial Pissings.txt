Come on people now, smile on your brother and
Everybody get together, try to love one another right now

When I was an alien, cultures weren't opinions

Gotta find a way, a better way, when I'm here
Gotta find a way - a better way - I'd better wait

Never met a wise man, if so it's a woman

Gotta find a way, a better way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way - a better way - I'd better wait

Gotta find a way, to find a way, when I'm here
Gotta find a way - a better way - I'd better wait

Just because you're paranoid, don't mean they're not after you

Gotta find a way, a better way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way - a better way - I'd better wait

Gotta find a way, to find a way, when I'm here
Gotta find a way - a better way - I'd better wait

Gotta find a way, a better way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way - a better way - I'd better wait

Gotta find a way, to find a way, when I'm here
Gotta find a way - a better way - I'd better wait
