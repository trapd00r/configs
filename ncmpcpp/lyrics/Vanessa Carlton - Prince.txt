Willing and able to run
I am
Willing and able I'm able to come (2x)

And if I wait for you now
Would you come
Would you run
Would you bring it back around
Oh, baby how (2x)

Willing and able to run
I am
Willing and able I'm able to come

If it all went away 
Nothin' left to say
oh Would you fight it or would you lay down
At the hand of your God oh could you see the light
Oh my prince can't you see what's been found

Willing and able to run
Willing and able to come 
willing and able to run, 
I am willing, I am willing,
willing,willing.

Willing and able to run
I am
Willing and able I'm able to come(2x)

And if I wait for you now
Would you come
Would you run
Would you bring it back around
Oh, baby how (2x)

Willing and able to run
I am
Willing and able I'm able to come(2x)
