There is no escaping (yo)(yooo)

You scream someone save me (yo) (yooo)
But they don't pay it no mind (yooo) (yooo)
(Good night)
Good bye

You're walking down a horror corridor
It's almost 4 in the morning and you're in a
Nightmare, it's horrible
Right there's the coroner
Waiting for you to turn the corner so he can corner ya
You're a goner, he's onto ya
Out the corner of his cornea
He just saw you run
All you want is to rest
Cause you can't run anymore, you're done
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody is watching in the party applauding it
Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Contemplating my next plot again
Swallowing a Klonopin while I'm noddin' in and out on the ottoman at the Ramada Inn
Holding onto the pill bottle then
Lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom
And make sure I got all of it
Wake up naked at McDonald's with
Blood all over me, dead bodies behind the counter, shit
Guess I must have just blacked out again
Not again

It's 3 A.M. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door an'
Bodies laying all over the floor an'
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must have killed 'em
Killed 'em

I said

It's 3 A.M. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door an'
Bodies laying all over the floor an'
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must have killed 'em
Killed 'em

Sitting nude in my living room
It's almost noon
I wonder what's on the tube
Maybe they'll show some boobs
Surfing every channel
Until I find Hannah Montana
Then I reach for the aloe and lanolin
Bust all over the wall panel and dismantling
Every candle on top of the fire place mantle and
Grab my flannel and my bandanna then
Kiss the naked mannequin man again
You can see him standing in my front window if you look in
I'm just a hooligan
Who's used to using hallucinogens
Causing illusions again
Brain contusions again
Cutting and bruising the skin
Razors, scissors, and pins
Jesus when does it end
Phases that I go through
Dazed and I'm so confused
Days that I don't know who
Gave these molecules to
Me, what am I gon' do
Hey the prodigal son
The diabolical one
Very methodical when I slaughter 'dem

It's 3 A.M. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door an'
Bodies laying all over the floor an'
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must have killed 'em
Killed 'em

I said

It's 3 A.M. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door an'
Bodies laying all over the floor an'
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must have killed 'em
Killed 'em

She puts the lotion in the bucket
It puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again
She puts the lotion in the bucket
It puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again

I duck and I slash, slice, and gash
Last night was a blast
I can't quite remember when I had that
Much fun off a half pint of the Jack
My last Vic' and a half
A flashlight up Kim Kardashian's ass
I remember the first time I dismembered a family member
December I think it was I was having drinks with my cousin
I wrapped him in Christmas lights
Pushed him into the stinking tub
Cut him up into pieces, then just when I went to drink his blood
I thought I aught to drink his bath water, that aught to be fun
That's when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me, that might be an artery son
Your blood curdling screams just don't seem to bother me none
It's 3 A.M. and here I come so you should probably run
A secret passage way around here, man there's got to be one
Oh no there's probably none, he can scream all that he wants, top of his lungs
It ain't no stopping me from chopping him up (up)

'Cause it's 3 A.M. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door an'
Bodies laying all over the floor an'
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must have killed 'em
Killed 'em

I said

It's 3 A.M. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door an'
Bodies laying all over the floor an'
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must have killed 'em
Killed 'em
