Remember when you were young
 You shone like the sun
 Shine on you crazy diamond
 Now there's a look in your eyes
 Like black holes in the sky
 Shine on you crazy diamond
 You were caught in the crossfire
 Of childhood and stardom
 Blown on the steel breeze
 Come on you target for faraway laughter
 Come on you stranger
 You legend
 You martyr
 And shine
 
 You reached for the secret too soon
 You cried for the moon
 Shine on you crazy diamond
 Threatened by shadows at night
 And exposed in the light
 Shine on you crazy diamond
 Well you wore out your welcome
 With random percision
 Rode on the steel breeze
 Come on you raver
 You seer of visions
 Come on you painter
 You piper
 You prisoner
 And shine
