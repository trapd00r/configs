You were working as a waitress in a cocktail bar 
When I met you I picked you out, I shook you up, and turned you around 
Turned you into someone new 
Now five years later on you've got the world at your feet 
Success has been so easy for you 
But don't forget it's me who put you where you are now 
And I can put you back down too 
Don't don't you want me? 
You know that I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me 
Don't don't you want me? 
You know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me 
It's much too late to find 
You think you've changed your mind 
You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry 
Don't you want me baby?
Don't you want me - oh 
Don't you want me baby ? 
Don't you want me - oh 
I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar 
That much is true 
But even then I knew I'd find a much better place 
Either with or without you 
The five years we have had have been such good times 
I still love you 
But now I think it's time I lived my life on my own 
I guess it's just what I must do 
Don't you want me baby ? 
Don't you want me - oh 
Don't you want me baby ? 
Don't you want me - oh
