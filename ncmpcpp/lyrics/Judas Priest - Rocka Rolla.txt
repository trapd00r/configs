Man eatin momma, steam driven hammer
Sorts the men out from the boys
Takes no messin', all in wrestlin'
Is one of her pride and joys

She a classy, flashy lassy
Imitation sapphire shine
Two faced liar, full of fire
But I know the flame is mine

Rocka rolla woman for a rocka rolla man
You can take her if you want her
If you think you can
Rocka rolla woman for a rocka rolla man
You can take her if you want her you can

She's a grip and choke ya
Heavy smoker
Wrong side of the law

Midnight shady
Good time lady
Heavy, ready show you what for

Barroom fighter
Ten pint a nighter
Definite ninety-nine

Diamond cluster
Knuckle duster
Feline on the borderline

Rocka rolla woman for a rocka rolla man
You can take her if you want her
If you think you can
Rocka rolla woman for a rocka rolla man
You can take her if you want her you can
