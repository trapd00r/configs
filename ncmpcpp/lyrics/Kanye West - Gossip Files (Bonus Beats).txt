Niggas gossiping, it runs the city, they don't know who watching them 
When they coming to get me, so I hit the block and bend 
Do about 60, and I put my glocks to them, like plow plow plow 

I'm gonna to get on this TV and put shit down 
I aint finna let these lights skinned niggaz come back in style 
I'm finna turn to this class clown, should be crazy deep 
They told my momma I was bipolar had A.D.D. 
I told em, what-what I wanna do, I wanna be a baller 
The dream spoilers are for ya 
Hatin on you to they mans on the corners 
Old folks said he'd never make it off the corner 
They are the virus that corrupts the soul 
They are the cubic zirconia inside the 10 karat gold 
That get green on ya, when you get green on em 
You gotta wash ya hands of em, get clean on em 
Somebody told me success is the best revenge 
So they gon be fucked up when you do ya thing on em 
Now hold ya plaques high, like who woulda thought 
And tell em, ahem, thank you for your no support 

They are the dreamkillers, they the dreamkillers 
Who know a dream, they are the dream (killer Norman Bates) 
They the dreamkillers, they the dreamkillers, dream 
They are the dream (killer Norman Bates) 

Now how you gonna talk about the way I spend my money 
Everybody say it with me now, it's my money 
And they know they hatin, but what they don't know is 
They are my motivation, they are my inspiration 
Cos we the leaders, and they the followers 
And we the nut busters, and they the swallowers 
They are the rumours, they are the lies 
We are the shit dog, and they the flies 
How you gon tell me how to live my life 
And you can't even get your own shit tight, right 
They are the misery that loves company 
Cuz that comfortable corporate job can't comfort me 
Told em I finished school, and I started my own business 
They said Oh you graduated? No I decided I was finished 
Chasin yall dreams and what you got planned 
Now I spit it so hot you got tanned 
And they hate on your relationship, then break your marriage up 
Can't kill ya dreams so they assassinate your character 
Do anything to downplay ya or embarrass ya 
Come around wit ya but they ain't down wit ya 
They the dreamkillers 

And I'm through spittin these rappers my most heartfelt flow 
They be like That's cool, you got some beats for me though? 
Oh I get it, you wanna be Snoop and Dr. Dre 
But don't nobody give a fuck what you got to say 
Anyway what you finna rap about? 
You never sold crack out ya house or put a gat to a mouth 
Or put ya fist to ya spouse, so how you gon move the crowd? 
I bet a thousand that you get booed out 
I even heard that they even takin wages in jail 
They bet ten boxes of cigarettes that I'm finna fail 
Second you talk about me, they be like Peace 
This nigga came from the Chi, moved to the east 
You gotta kill at least one person at least 
Or we'll evict you from the rap game, cancel your lease 
How you go to New York, what you ain't never took a tour there? 
What you ain't know you gotta be rich just to be poor there? 
The dreamkillers
