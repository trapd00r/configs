I got to have a shot
'Cause what you got is oh so sweet
You got to make it hot
Like a boomerang, I need a repeat

Gimme all your lovin'
All your hugs and kisses too
Gimme all your lovin'
Don't let up until we're through

You got to whip it up
And hit me like a ton of lead
If I blow my top
Will you let it go to your head?

Gimme all your lovin'
All your hugs and kisses too
Gimme all your lovin'
Don't let up until we're through

You got to move it up
And use it like a schoolboy would
You got to pack it up
Work it like a new boy should

Gimme all your lovin'
All your hugs and kisses too
Gimme all your lovin'
Don't let up until we're through
