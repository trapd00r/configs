We live in every moment but this one
Why don't we recognize the faces loving us so

What's God if not the spark that started life
Smile of a stranger
Sweet music, starry skies
Wonder, mystery, wherever my road goes
Early wake-ups in a moving home
Scent of fresh-mown grass in the morning sun
Open theme park gates waiting for

Riding the day, every day into sunset
Finding the way back home

Once upon a night we'll wake to the carnival of life
The beauty of this ride ahead such an incredible high
It's hard to light a candle, easy to curse the dark instead
This moment the dawn of humanity
The last ride of the day

Wake up, Dead Boy
Enter adventureland
Tricksters, magicians will show you all that's real
Careless jugglers, snakecharmers by your trail
Magic of a moment
Abracadabra

Riding the day, every day into sunset
Finding the way back home

Once upon a night we'll wake to the carnival of life
The beauty of this ride ahead such an incredible high
It's hard to light a candle, easy to curse the dark instead
This moment the dawn of humanity
The last ride of the day
