Yo, this guys a choke-artist
Ya
catch a bad one
Ya better off shootin ya-self wit Popa
Doc's handgun
Climbin up this mountain, ya weak
I
leave ya lost witout a paddle, floatin shit's creek
You ain't Detroit, I'm the D
You tha new kid on
the block, bout to get smacked back to the boone-docks
Fuckin Nazi, this crowd ain't ya type
Take some real
advice
And form a group with Vanilla Ice
And what I
tell ya
Ya better use it
This guy's a hillbilly
this ain't Willie Nelson music
Trailer trash
I
choke ya till ya last breath
And have ya lookin foolish
like Cheddar Bob when he shot his-self
Silly Rabbit, I know
why they call you that
Cuz you follow Future, like he got
carrots up his asscrack
And when you act it up, that's
when you got jacked up
And left stupid like Tina Turner
when she got smacked up
I crack ya shoulderblade
You'll get dropped so hard that Elvis will start turnin
in his grave
I don't know why they left you out in the
dark
Ya need to take your white ass back across 8 Mile to
the trailer park
(Crowd Cheers)

(Rabbit/Eminem)
This guy raps like his parents jerked
him
He sounds like Eric Sermon
The generic version
This whole crowd looks suspicious
It's all dudes in
here
Except for these bitches
So I'm a German
ay?
That's ok, you look like a fuckin worm with
braids
These leaders of the Free World rookies
Lookie,
how can 6 dicks be pussies
Talkin bout shit's creek,
bitch you can be a piss creek
Wit paddles this deep
Ya
still gonna sink
Your a disgrace
Ya they call me
Rabbit
This is a turtle race
He can't get wit me
spittin this shit
Wickedy Lickety shot
Spicious
spickety split Lickety
So I'ma turn around wit a great
smile
And walk my white ass back across 8 Mile
(Crowd
cheers)

And don't come back until somethin dope hits you
