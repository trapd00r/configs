Oh, my love

Oh yeah ...

Oh yeah...

I'm sitting here alone up in my room
and thinking about the times that we've been through
(oh my love)
I'm looking at a picture in my hand
Trying my best to understand
I really wanna know what we did wrong
with a love that felt so strong
if only you were here tonight
I know that we could make it right

(chorus)
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
Cause you're the only one within my heart
I was born to make you happy
Always and forever you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy

I know I've been a fool since you've been gone
I better give it up and then carry on (oh my love)
Cause living in a dream of you and me
Is not the way my life should be
I don't wanna cry a tear for you, so forgive me if I do
If only you were here tonight
I know that we could make it right

(chorus)
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
Cause you're the only one within my heart
I was born to make you happy
Always and forever you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy

Oh yeah...

I'd do anything
I'd give you my world
I'd wait forever to be your girl
Just call out my name (just call out my name)
And I will be there (and I will be there)
Just to show you how much I care

Alright
I was born to make you happy
Yeah, yeah...
Oh yeah, yeah

(chorus)
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
Cause you're the only one within my heart
I was born to make you happy
Always and forever you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy

Oh no, no
I was born to make you happy
Oh yeah, oh oh yeah

Always and forever you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
