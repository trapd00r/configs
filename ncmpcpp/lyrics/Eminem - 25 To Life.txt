Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life

Yeah
Too late
I can't keep, chasing you
I'm taking my life back
Caught in a chase, 25 to life

Singing
I don't think she understands, the sacrifices that I've made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right, I would have stayed
But I've already wasted over half my life, I would have laid
Down and died for you, I no longer cry for you, no more pain

Bitch you, took me for granted took my heart and ran it
Straight into the planet, into the dirt I can no longer stand it
An' now my respect I demand it, I'ma take control of this relationship command it
And I'ma be the boss of you now goddammit

And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out, this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you I have stayed
Faithful all the way, this is how I fuckin' get repaid

Look at how I dress, fuckin' baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you, I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me, I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothin' less, than perfectness

And I know that if I end this, I'll no longer have nothin' left
But you keep treatin' me like a staircase, it's time to fuckin' step
And I won't be comin' back, so don't hold your fuckin' breath
You know what you've done, no need to go in depth

I told you'd be sorry if I fuckin' left, I'd laugh while you wept
How's it feel now, yeah funny ain't it
You neglected me, did me a favor though my spirit free you've set
But a special place for you, in my heart I have kept, it's unfortunate but it's

Too late for the other side (Yeah)
Caught in a chase, 25 to life (Can't take no more (Can't take no more))
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life

I feel like when I bend over  (Too late) backwards for you, all you do is laugh
'Cause that ain't good enough, you expect me to fold myself in half
Till I snap, don't think I'm loyal, all I do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side, I have no life outside of that

Don't I give you enough of my time, you don't think so do you
Jealous when I spend time with the girls, why I'm married to you
Still man I don't know, but tonight I'm serving you with papers
I'm divorcin' you, go marry someone else and make 'em famous

And take away their freedom, like you did to me, treat 'em
Like you don't need 'em, and they ain't worthy of you, feed 'em
The same shit that you made me eat, I'm movin' on forget you
Oh, now I'm special, I ain't feel special when I was with you

All I ever felt was dissed, helplessness, imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out, I fell for this so many times, it's ridiculous
And still I stick with this, I'm sick of this
But in my sickness and addiction, you're addictive as they get

Evil as they come, vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep askin' me, why I can't just walk away from 'em
I'm addicted, to the pain the stress the drama, I'm drawn to shit
I guess I'm a, mess, cursed and blessed

But this time I ain't changin' my mind, I'm climbin' out this abyss
You're screamin' as I walk out, that I'll be missed
But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you, you left me off your list
Fuck you hip-hop, I'm leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch, and it's just

Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
I'm gone man
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life

Too late
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
