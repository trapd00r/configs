Half a week before the winter 
The chill bites before it comes 
And I'm a child of the pleasure 
Daddy brings before he runs 

He sits behind a desk of mahogany 
He whispers dreams into my ear 
And though I've given him his empire 
He delivers me my fear 

The unicorns are riding high 
Powerful in coats of white 
I turn to look and burn my eyes 
I carry on, I carry all the weight of empty promise 
As I stand, swallowed by the light 
Flickering above the highway 
I hold my head and know the streets are mine tonight 

The vampires are growing tired 
The coats of white all turn to red 
My heart burns with desire 
I carry on, I carry on 

The unicorns are riding high 
Powerful in coats of white 
We turn to look and burn our eyes 
I carry on, I carry 

The vampires are growing tired 
The coats of white all turn to red 
My heart burns with desire 
I carry on, I carry on 
I carry on, I carry on 
We carry on
