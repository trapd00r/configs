Not for lack of a gentle mother
I do lack a mental cover
It keeps on pounding my head
We'll order water
Torture sauce and economics
Every day just more comics
In a pissing contest
That started out with atomic bombs
Mom will they drop the bomb
Will they think about their children's children
Be a forwardless mess and this
No one to call
You can't make them stall
I want to feed them to each other
Cause I'm sick of them all

How can't you see something's missing
Is anyone listening
We're shooting up flares
Does anyone care

They got this world locked down bound and gagged
From the reds in Pine Ridge to that land in Baghdad

When did our leaders
Become bottom feeders
We're shooting up flares
Does anyone care

They got this world locked down bound and gagged
With constant fear and paranoia toxins in our head

It's just something they know how to do
How to make everyone feel uncalm
The masses just take it while they turn the screws
Bring to a boil, add oil, then bomb
It's just something that we got to fight
How to make everyone feel uncalm
Keep us distracted with with fuel to ignite.

Porno shows, MTV hoes, and all the radio
It's the same fucking song
That's just the way it goes
Cold turkey world to democracy's girls
From the rules of engagements sweet heart
This is the world

How can so many sit silent
Enough to the violence
We're shooting up flares
Does anyone care

They got this world locked down bound and gagged
The Botox, Barbie dolls, and magazine ads

It's just something they know how to do
How to make everyone feel uncalm
The masses just take it while they turn the screws
Bring to a boil, add oil, then bomb
Embodying all that we know to be wrong
How to make everyone feel uncalm
When a war chant becomes a popular song
