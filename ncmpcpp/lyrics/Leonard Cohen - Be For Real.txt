Are you back in my life to stay
Or is it just for today
Oh that you're gonna need me?
If it's a thrill you're looking for
Honey, I'm flexible.
Oh, yeah.

Just be for real won't you, Baby
Be for real oh, Baby
You see I, I don't want to be hurt by love again!

So you see I'm not naive.
I just would like to believe
Ah what you tell me.
So don't give me the world today
And tomorrow take it away.
Don't do that to me, darling.

Just be for real won't you, Baby
Be for real won't you, Baby

Been hurt so many times see I, I don't want to be hurt by love again!

(I don't give a damn about the truth, Baby
Except for the naked truth. Oh yeah)
Just be for real won't you, Baby
Be for real won't you, Baby

No, no, no, no
It's just that I,I don't want to be hurt by love again!

Thanks for the song Mr. Knight!
