Wake up, jumped out my bed 
Hung in a 2 man cell wit my homie Lil 1/2 Dead 
Murder was the case that they gave me 
Dear God, I wonder can you save me 
I'm only 18, so I'm a young buck 
It's a ride, if I don't scrap, I'm getting stuck 
But that's the life of a G, I guess 
Ese's way deep, shanked two in they chest 
Bests run 'cause brothers is dropping quicker 
Ugn, too late, damn, down goes another nigga 
Bouncing off the walls, throwing them dogs 
Getting a rep as a young hog 
It ain't nothing like the street life 
Betta be strapped wit yo clip, 'cause ain't no fist fight 
So I guess I gots ta handle mine 
Since I did the crime, I gots ta do my time 

[Chorus]
Lil' ghetto boy 
Playing in the ghetto streets 
What'cha gonna do when you grow up 
And have to face responsibility 

[Dr. Dre]
Now, I'm 'trolling the dove, sitting on swoll 
27 years old, off on parole, stroll 
I'm back up on my feet wit my mind on the money 
That I'm making as soon as I touch the street 
Things done changed but it's alright 
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right 
But it ain't no thing to me 
Cause now I'm what they call a loced-assed O.G. 
The little homies from the hood wit grip 
are the ones I get with cause I'm down to set-trip 
Nigga, I'm bigger than you, so what ya want to do 
Didn't know we had a 22 
Straight sitting behind his back 
I'm grab his pockets and then I heard six caps 
I fell to the ground wit blood on my hands 
I didn't understand 
How a nigga so young could bust a cap 
I use to be the same way back 
I guess that's what I get (for what) 
For trying to jack them little homies for they bread 

[Chorus]

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Something for the real OG's to get wit 
Some facts, made our made, now you want to run and play 
Like every single day, really doe 
You know me, I'm the smooth macadamia, gaming them for my homie 
No need to be uncalm if you pack right 
And learning just enough to keep your sack right 
Late nights, I wonder what they getting fo' 
Early morning on the corners, what they hitting fo' 
Seven young G's put they serve down 
In a jeep ride, east side what they swerve now 
Not thinking about what's really going on 
Got crept on, stepped on, now they gone 
I spent 4 years in the county wit nutting but convicts around me 
But now I'm back at the pound 
And we expose ways for the youth to survive 
Some think it's wrong but we tend to think it's right 
So make all them ends you can make 
'Cause when you're broke, you break, check it out 
So ain't no need for your mama to trip 
'Cause you's a hustling ass youngsta, clocking your grip 

[Chorus]
