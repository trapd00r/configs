Listen, hear, he is inside
One who lives while others lie
I close my eyes and walk a thousand years
A thousand years that aren't mine

It seems he's near me as I walk
One who loved what love denied
He lives these years that I walk blind
All these years cannot be mine

Tomorrow begat tomorrow
Begat tomorrow
Begat tomorrow

A thousand doors a thousand lies
Rooms a thousand years wide
He walks in the cold sun and wind
All these years will not begin

Tomorrow begat tomorrow
Begat tomorrow
Begat tomorrow
