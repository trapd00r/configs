Remember the days of the old schoolyard
We used to laugh a lot, oh don't you 
Remember the days of the old schoolyard 
When we had imaginings and we had 
All kinds of things and we laughed 
And needed love... yes, I do 
Oh and I remember you 
Remember the days of the old schoolyard 
We used to cry a lot, oh don't you 
Remember the days of the old schoolyard 
When we had simplicity and we had 
Warm toast for tea and we laughed 
And needed love.. yes, I do 
Oh and I remember you 

You were my sweet love, my first sweet love 
My lovey dove my love, lovey dove 
No matter what place, whichever the place 
I still see your face, your smiling face 
In childish dreams, inside my dreams 
Like King and Queen, God save our dreams 
N'though time may face, though time may fade 
It ain't never too late, to learn about love 
Learn about love 

Remember the days of the old schoolyard
We used to laugh a lot, oh don't you
