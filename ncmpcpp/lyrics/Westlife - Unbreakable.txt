Took my hands
Touched my heart
Held me close
You were always there
By my side
Night and day
Through it all
Baby come what may

Swept away on a wave of emotion
Oh we're caught in the eye of the storm
And, whenever you smile 
I can hardly believe that you're mine
Believe that you're mine

This love is unbreakable
It's unmistakable
And each time I look in your eyes
I know why
This love is untouchable
A feeling my heart just can't deny
Each time I look in your eyes
Oh baby, I know why
This love is unbreakable

Shared the laughter
Shared the tears
We both know
We'll go on from here

'Cause together 
We are strong
In my arms
That's where you belong

I've been touched by the hands of an angel
I've been blessed by the power of love
And whenever you smile 
I can hardly believe that you're mine
Believe that you're mine

This love is unbreakable
It's unmistakable
Each time I look in your eyes
I know why
This love is untouchable
A feeling my heart just can't deny
Each time you whisper my name
Oh baby, I know why

This love is unbreakable
Through fire and flame
When all this is over
Our love still remains

This love is unbreakable
It's unmistakable
Each time I look in your eyes
I know why
This love is untouchable
A feeling my heart just can't deny
Each time you whisper my name 
Oh baby, I know why
'Cos each time I look in your eyes
Oh baby, I know why

This love is unbreakable
