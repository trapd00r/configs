I close my eyes, the lantern dies
The scent of awakening, wild-honey and dew
Childhood games, woods and lakes
Streams of silver, toys of olden days

Meadows of Heaven

The flowers of wonder and the hidden treasures
In the meadow of life, my acre of Heaven
A five-year-old winter heart in a place called home
Sailing the waves of past

Meadows of Heaven

Rocking chair without a dreamer
A wood and a spring without laughter?
Sandbox without toy soldiers
Yuletide without the flight, dream-bound for life

Flowers wither, treasures stay hidden
Until I see the first star of fall
I fall asleep and see it all:
Mother’s care and color of the kites

Meadows of Heaven
