If you were to kill me now right here
I would still look you in the eye
And I would burn myself into your memory 
As long as you were still alive

I would live inside of you
I'd make you wear me like a scar 
And I would burn myself 
Into your memory
And run through everything you are

I would not run
I would not turn
I would not hide

I would not run
I would not turn
I would not hide

In the eye

If you were to kill me now right here
I would still look you in the eye
And I would burn myself 
Into your memory
As long as you were still alive

I would not run
I would not turn
I would not hide

I would not run
I would not turn
I would not hide

In the eye
Look me in the eye
