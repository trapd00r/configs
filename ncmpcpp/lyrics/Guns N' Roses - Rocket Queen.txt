If I say I don't need anyone
I can say these things to you 
'Cause I can turn on anyone 
Just like I turned on you

I've got a tongue like a razor 
A sweet switchblade knife 
And I can do you favors 
But then you'll do whatever I like 

Here I am 
And you're a Rocket Queen 
I might be a little young 
But honey I ain't naive 

Here I am 
And you're a Rocket Queen, oh yeah 
I might be too much 
But honey you're a bit obscene

I've seen everything imaginable 
Pass before these eyes 
I've had everything that's tangible 
Honey you'd be surprised 

I'm a sexual innuendo 
In this burned out paradise
If you turn me on to anything 
You better turn me on tonight

Here I am 
And you're a Rocket Queen 
I might be a little young 
But honey I ain't naive 

Here I am 
And you're a Rocket Queen, oh yeah 
I might be too much 
But honey you're a bit obscene

Here I am 
And you're a Rocket Queen 
I might be a little young 
But honey I ain't naive 

Here I am 
And you're a Rocket Queen, oh yeah 
I might be too much 
But honey you're a bit obscene

I see you standing, standing on your own 
It's such a lonely place for you, for you to be 
If you need a shoulder or if you need a friend 
I'll be here standing until the bitter end 

No one needs the sorrow 
No one needs the pain 
I hate to see you 
Walking out there, out in the rain

So don't chastise me
Or think I, I mean you harm 
Of those that take you 
Leave you strung out much too far, baby, yeah

Woah, no, woah, woah, baby, yeah

Don't ever leave me 
Say you'll always be there
All I ever wanted 
Was for you to know that I care
