Hey....(That's the way I like it)

Somebody told me that you're not my kind so have I lost my mind

You keep on doing all the things I like you got me hypnotised

(But) That's the way I like it

Girl you make me wanna move, it's a price I got to pay

For all the things you do, but I like it

*Gotta listen to the groove and you gotta listen well

The way I go, that's the way I like it

CHORUS:

Everybody now (I like it)

Everybody now (That's the way I like it)

Everybody come on (I like it)

Everybody come on (That's the way I like it)

Oh mystery lady you've got something I like

Tell me you're here to stay

You're dangerous so baby could you do me right

Will you come out to play

Cause that's the way I like it

REPEAT *

CHORUS

Everybody com'on (I like it)

Everybody com'on

REPEAT *

That's the way that I like it

That is the way I like it

That's the way that I like it

Everybody now,everybody com'on (REPEAT WHOLE VERSE)

That's the way I like it
