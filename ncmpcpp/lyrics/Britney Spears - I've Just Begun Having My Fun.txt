[Bonus Track]

Here is a little story that I made up
So Let's make believe
Four years ago I had a party
that was too much fun for me
Boy there's a sexy guy 
He said he'd give me everything i need
Sometimes I let temptation go too far
and get the best of me
All I gotta say is
I just wanna have some fun
And I'll do it until I'm done
I'm telling you
I'm just a crazy kind of girl
I'll tell it to the world
I've just begun having my fun (yeah)
Inside me there's something I found
I wanna shop around
I just begun
Don't wanna settle down
The conversation was going no where 'til I turned my hair
He started touching me and kissing me
Like he didn't care
I thought at first I should go home
But then fell asleep in the chair
All I gotta say is
I just wanna have some fun
And I'll do it until I'm done
I'm telling you
I'm just a crazy kind of girl
I'll tell it to the world
I've just begun having my fun (yeah)
Inside me there's something I found
I wanna shop around
I just begun
Don't wanna settle down
I'm just a crazy kind of girl
I'll tell it to the world
I've just begun having my fun (yeah)
Inside me there's something I found
I wanna shop around
I just begun
Don't wanna settle down
I just wanna have a good time
I just wanna be myself
And don't let nobody tell you it's any differantly
I wanna enjoy the sunshine
And do the things that I need
To see what feels good to me
I'm just so crazy
I'm just a crazy kind of girl
I'll tell it to the world
I've just begun having my fun (yeah)
Inside me there's something I found
I wanna shop around
I just begun
Don't wanna settle down
I just begun
I just begun
having my fun
I just begun 
Having my fun, yeah!
