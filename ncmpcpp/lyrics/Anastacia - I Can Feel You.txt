Yeah
Tell me what have you done to me, oh
How come your eyes feel like your hands on me?

(Am I under some magic spell?)
Oh, did you put a hex on my body
(I'm aroused though, boy can't you tell?)
I can't explain it or fight it boy
Cuz I like it

I can feel you from my head (head) to my feet (feet)
You're all over me
I can feel you, when you're not (not) next to me (me)
Taking over me
I can feel you when I kiss you baby
Touch you baby, love you baby
(I can feel you baby if I) kiss you baby
Touch you baby, love you baby, oh

You're in control I'm a slave
To your will baby
Baby you gotta hold on me
Yes your name gives me chills

(am I under some magic spell?)
Oh, did you put a hex on my body?
(I'm aroused though, boy can't you tell?)
Said I can't explain it or fight it

I can feel you from my head (head) to my feet (feet)
You're all over me
I can feel you when I kiss you baby
Touch you baby, love you

Feels like you're inside
Pushing my buttons
Making me do what you want me to do
(Baby you're not by side)
Baby I can still feel you, oh whoa

Touch you baby, love you baby, oh
