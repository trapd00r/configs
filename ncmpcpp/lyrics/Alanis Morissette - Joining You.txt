dear dar(lin') your mom, my friend
left a message on my machine she was frantic 
saying you were talking crazy
that you wanted to do away with yourself
i guess she thought i'd be a perfect resort
because we've had this inexplicable connection since our youth
and yes they're in shock they are panicked
you and your chronic them and their drama
you this embarrassment us in the middle of this delusion

if we were our bodies
if we were our futures
if we were our defenses i'd be joining you
if we were our culture
if we were our leaders
if we were our denials i'd be joining you

i remember vividly a day years ago
we were camping you knew more than you thought you should know
you said "I don't ever want to be brainwashed"
and you were mindboggling you were intense
you were uncomfortable in your own skin you were thirsty
but mostly you were beautiful

if we were our nametags
if we were our rejections
if we were our outcomes i'd be joining you
if we were our indignities
if we were our successes
if we were our emotions i'd be joining you

you and i we're like 4 year olds
we want to know why and how come about everything
we want to reveal ourselves at will and speak our minds
and never talk small and be intuitive
and question mightily and find god my tortured beacon
we need to find like-minded companions

if we were their condemnations
if we were their projections
if we were our paranoias i'd be joining you
if we were our incomes
if we were our obsessions
if we were our afflictions i'd be joining you

we need reflection we need a really good memory
feel free to call me a little more often
