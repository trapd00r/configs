Well nobody loves me, baby
Nobody seems to care
Well nobody loves me, babe
Nobody seems to care
Well, ever since my mother passed
Nothin' but misery everywhere

Well I ain't got no money, baby
And my best friends have put me down
Hallelujah, I said I ain't got no money, baby
And my best friends have put me down, oh Lord
Well, all of my good-time buddies
Don't even come around

Well, if you listen to me, baby
Maybe I could find a new life in you
Well, if you listen to me, baby child
Maybe I could find a new life in you
Well, if you'll be mine forever, baby
Child, I never can be blue
