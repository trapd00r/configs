Look deep INTO the April face
A change is clearly taking place
Looking for the summer

The eyes take on a certain gaze
And leave behind the springtime days
Go looking for the summer

This ain't no game of kiss and tell
The implications how you KNEW so well
Go looking for the summer

The time has come and they must go
To play the passion out that haunts you so
Looking for the summer

Remember love how it was the same
We scratched and hurt each OTHER'S growing pains
We were looking for the summer

And still I stand this very day
With a burning wish to fly away
I'm still looking, looking for the summer
