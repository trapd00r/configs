Oh no, I see
A spider web is tangled up with me
And I lost my head
The thought of all the stupid things I'd said

Oh no, what's this?
A spider web, and I'm caught in the middle
So I turned to run
The thought of all the stupid things I'd done

And I never meant to cause you trouble
I never meant to do you wrong
I, well if I ever caused you trouble
Oh no, I never meant to do you harm

Oh no, I see
A spider web and it's me in the middle
So I twist and turn
But here am I in my little bubble

Singing out, I never meant to cause you trouble
I never meant to do you wrong
I, well if I ever caused you trouble
Oh no, I never meant to do you harm

They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me
