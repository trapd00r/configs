It won't do
To dream of caramel
To think of cinnamon
And long for you

It won't do
To stir a deep desire
To fan a hidden fire
That can never burn true

I know your name
I know your skin
I know the way
These things begin

But I don't know
How I would live with myself
What I'd forgive of myself
If you don't go

So goodbye
Sweet appetite
No single bite
Could satisfy

I know your name
I know your skin
I know the way
These things begin

But I don't know
How I would live with myself
What I would give of myself
If you don't go

It won't do
To dream of caramel
To think of cinnamon
And long for you
