I saw him dancing there
By the record machine
I knew he must have
Been about seventeen
The beat was going strong
Playing my favorite song
I could tell
It wouldn't be long
Till he was with me
Yeah, with me
And I could tell
It wouldn't be long
Till he was with me
Yeah, with me

Singin'

I love rock 'n' roll
So put another dime
In the jukebox
Baby
I love rock 'n' roll
So come and
Take the time
And dance with me

Ow

He smiled, so I got up
And asked for his name
"But that don't matter," he said
"'Cause it's all the same."
I said, "Can I take you home
Where we can play alone?"
And next we
Were moving on
And he was with me
Yeah, with me
And we were moving on
And singin' that
Same old song
Yeah, with me
