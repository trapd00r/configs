Like a long lonely stream I keep runnin' towards a dream, 
movin' on, movin' on.
Like a branch on a tree I keep reachin' to be free, 
movin' on, movin' on.
 
'Cause there's a place in the sun where there's hope for ev'ry one, 
where my poor restless heart's gotta run.
Theres' a place in the sun and before my life is done,
Got to find me a place in the sun.
 
Like an old dusty road
I get weary from the load,
movin' on, movin' on.
Like this tired troubled earth 
I've been rollin' since my birth,
movin' on, movin' on.
 
'Cause there's a place in the sun where there's hope for ev'ry one, 
where my poor restless heart's gotta run.
Theres' a place in the sun and before my life is done,
Got to find me a place in the sun.
