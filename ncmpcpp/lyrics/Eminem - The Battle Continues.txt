Send "1 Day at a Time" Ringtone to your Cell Sometimes its hard, to wake up in the morning
Mind full of demons, I dont wanna hear 'em anymore
Got me heartbroken, fine, So many babies screamin
Cuz they seeing destruction before they see a human being
So they start smokin weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families safe
Cuz they all broken, why? Two ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly
Somebody else can say im pokin guns, smokin weed
Can all make the change so im told but i havent seen a change unfold
I keep hopin, please! If you prefer to breath
Communities in need, of people that we lead
Keep your eyes open now, then only say I try
Until the day I die, I promised to be wise
With my heart open, greed, brings only misery
A weight of tragedy, so I stay sucker free
Only a few chosen rise, my ghetto queens rise
Dont be afraid to try, too many of us die
For the thought of hopen wise, my brothers speak wise
They focus on the prize, till everybody dies

(Part 2: Eminem)
We could only learn to take, our anger and our hate
Control our mental state, settle down and just set it straight
Maybe we could learn to take, a second to pump the brakes
But we said it, regret it later, and let it escalade
Cuz by then its just too late, theres so much we can take
Theres only so much someone can swallow and tolerate
Till the point that he just breaks, snaps and thats all it takes
You think that we was learnin from other rappers mistakes
But we aint, his brain will go against
With every artist comes an image he portrays
And a picture that he paints
But in the midst of all this anger and this gangs
Never once did you hear me say I'm a gangsta
And I aint hear no complaints
But I know, that I will always continue to grow
As long as I lead, and never follow noone else's shadow
There will never be another me, and that I will guarantee
Its that why I remain sucker free, to this day
The game, will never be the same
No matter how much fame or success they attain
There will never be another me
And no matter what they do, there will never be another you
You can search but you'll never find
You can try to rewind time, but in your hearts and your minds
We will never die, we are forever alive
When we continue going, one day at a time

(Part 3: Outlawz #1)
Dont get caught in the publicity, and caught in the hype
Rappers are, regular people minus money and lights
Searchin for, fortune and fame and super stardom
All the jewelry, all the cars, who screws the hardest
Now the Hip Hop Police's surveillance is watchin
And the kids think beef is their only option
Outlawz, poor and filthy, guilty as charged
My memories they can die, my -Makaveli- lives on
You think the industry is fun, and no pity with guns
And when your money is up, thats when your enemies come
So if he died and came back, would he try to save rap
We needin a change, the drama remains

(Part 4: Outlawz #2)
I spend my whole life,(yeah) fightin myself
That, I cant win, so I'm invitin some help
And every now and then, I take rights on the left
I'm still just like a kid, lookin for stripes on my belt
That day is a fight in itself
So I just pray and hope God take a light to myself
No matter how much I try to stay alive, I'mma die, mad
Still standin and in love with my pride

(Part 5: Outlawz #3)
My hard frivilous beef, we passed that
Im tryna keep some in c-comin and then collect on my ass cap
But rappers in the game aint changed
And I finally realized that we not in the same game
The hatin will never end, so I guess I'll deal with it
Them 4-5 a cop, chillers just I'm still with it
Them streets is military, you gotta be a soldier
Gotta stay lirry and keep your eyes on the Rollers
They do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us
So we gotta do it, we gotta do to keep growin
One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind
When we continue growin, one day at a time (Damn!)
