Oxygen 
You touch my skin 
Change the mood I'm in 
Teach me how to fly 
Just by looking in my eyes 
Every word you say 
Sets my heart on fire 
Every move you make 
Takes me higher 
I get so high up here 
When I touch the sky 
It hurts me when I breathe 
I need oxygen 
Whenever you are near I can hardly speak 
It hurts me when I breathe 
I need oxygen 
I need oxygen 
I need 
Suddenly 
Suddenly I see 
How great my life can be 
Sailing in the wind 
With you my love 
Every day is brighter 
I get so high up here 
When I touch the sky 
It hurts me when I breathe 
I need oxygen 
Whenever you are near I can hardly speak 
It hurts me when I breathe 
I need oxygen 
I need oxygen 
I need 
With you my love 
Everyday is brighter
