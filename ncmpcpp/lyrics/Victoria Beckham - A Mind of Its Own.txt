I look at you and I know you're trouble
I should run just fast as I can
Yeah! One smile, Game over, Here in front of you I stand

I know your only gonna burst my bubble
Trouble is, my heart don't care
It's ignoring all the danger signs
Stop, Slow down, take a deep breath, beware

I'm not willing to be so fearless- careless, just yet
Cos' Once bitten twice shy , is what you get

My hearts got a mind of it's own
Won't listen to a word I say
Doesn't it know that I get hurt too
When it acts that way -------
Cos' When it breaks I break
I don't know - how much more of this I can take
Doesn't it know that I get hurt too
When it acts that way

Too many times I've witnessed
My heart make a fool of it s self
So sure it's gonna turn out one way
always turns out being somethin' else

my hearts got a real malfunction
always flippin' into over ride
when I tell it to be sensible
uh! It over rules my cynical mind

I'm not willing to be so open ,Transparent, No not yet
Cos' Once bitten twice shy , , is what you get
But here in front of you, there's nothin I can do

Chorus

Stop, Slow down, take a deep breath,(Breath) think about what I'm doin'
Think about once Bitten , twice shy
Stop, Slow down, take second, (Breath) before U rust right in
It's gonna be my tears you cry
