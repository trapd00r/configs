(Chorus)
Always lived my life alone, 
Been searching for a place called home. 
I know that I've been cold as ice, 
Ignored the dreams, too many lies. 
Somewhere deep inside, Somewhere deep inside me, 
I found ... the child I used to be
And I know that it's not too late 
Never,
Too late... 

3 AM!
The painted cow ! 
Yeaaaaaaaaaaah!!
You ain't stoppin' us now ! 
(Wonderful human beings) (HEY!)
Yeah ! I am the Junglist souljah.
Come On! 
The rocket launcher stopped ya! (HEY!)
It's not a bird, it's not a plane ...
It must be Dave who's on the train...
Wanna wanna get'cha, gonna gonna get'cha!
Tell 'em that I told ya
Yeah! 

(Chorus)
Always lived my life alone, 
Been searching for a place called home. 
I know that I've been cold as ice,
Ignored the dreams, too many lies.
Somewhere deep inside, 
Somewhere deep inside me, 
I found ... the child I used to be
And I know that it's not too late 
Never,
To late... 

Alright !
Are you ready? It's not a game!
I chant so much, I turn you insane. 
Wanna wanna get'cha, gonna gonna get'cha! 
Messing up the area...Yeah! (Hey!)

Come On! (Hey!)
I am the freshman. 
Messing up the jam! 
Turning up the stereo 
Join the caravan ... (Hey!)

Skippy, the rain won't come! 

(End Chorus)
Somewhere deep inside, 
Somewhere deep inside me, 
I found ... the child I used to be.
And I know that it's not too late,
Never,
To late...
