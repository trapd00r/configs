I know the desert can't hold all the love
that I feel in my heart for you
If I could spread it out across the sea,
I know my love would cork it up
Ain't that a lot of love for one heart to hold

If the bees only knew how sweet you are baby
They would seal up their honeycomb
If the birds could hear how sweet your voice is
They would tighten up the song
Ain't that a lot of love for one heart to hold
Your lips are so sweet, honey you're my every need
You got a smile so rare
A love like yours I just can't compare
Ain't that a lot of love for one heart to hold
Ain't that a lot of love for one heart to hold

If the cook in the kitchen had a touch as hot as yours
They wouldn't need a fire
I can't think of a word that describes you better
Than the sight of her
