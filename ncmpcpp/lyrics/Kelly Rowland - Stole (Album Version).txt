He was always such a nice Boy
The quiet one
With good intentions
He was down for his brother
Respectful to his mother
A good boy
but good don't get attention
One kid with a promise
The brightest kid in school
He's not a fool
Reading books about science and smart stuff
It's not enough, no
Cause smart dont make you cool, whoa

He's not invisible anymore
With his Father's 9 and a broken fuse
Since he walked through that classroom door
He's all over primetime news

Mary's got the same size hands 
As Marilyn Monroe
She put her fingers in the imprints
at Mann's Chinese Theatre show
She coulda been a movie star
Never got the chance to go that far
Her life was stole 
Now we'll never know

No no no no oh

They were cryin' to the camera
Said he never fitted in
He wasn't welcome
He showed up to the parties
They was hanging in
Some guys were puttin' him down
Bullying him round round
Now I wish I woulda talked to him
Gave him the time of day
Not turn away
If I woulda been the one to maybe go this far
He might have stayed at home
Playing angry chords on his guitar

He's not invisible anymore
With his baggy pants and his legs in chains
Since he walked through that classroom door
Everybody knows his name

Mary's got the same size hands (Oh)
As Marilyn Monroe
She put her fingers in the imprints (Ooh)
at Mann's Chinese Theatre show
She coulda been a movie star 
Never got the chance to go that far
Her life was stole 
Now we'll never know
(Now we'll never know, oh)

Greg was always getting net from 20 feet away (20 feet away)
He had a tryout with the Sixers
Couldn't wait for Saturday (Saturday)
Now we're never gonna see him slam
Flying high as Kobe can
