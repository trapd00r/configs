(Mmm, yeah)
Yeah-yeah yeah-yeah yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah yeah-yeah yeah-yeah

I think I did it again
I made you believe, we're more than just friends (friends)
Oh baby, it might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious
'Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Oh baby, baby

Oops I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Ooh, baby, baby, oops, you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above 
I'm not that innocent

You see my problem is this
I'm dreaming away
Wishing that heroes they truly exist
I cry, watching the Days
Can't you see I'm a fool, in so many ways
But to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Oh, baby, oh

Oops I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Ooh, baby, baby, oops, you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above 
I'm not that innocent

Yeah-yeah yeah-yeah yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah yeah-yeah yeah-yeah

"All aboard"
"Britney, before you go, there's something I want you to have"
"Oh, it's beautiful, but wait a minute, isn't this...?"
"Yeah, yes it is"
"But I thought the old lady dropped it into the ocean in the end"
"Well baby, I went down and got it for you"
"Oh, you shouldn't have!"

Oops I, did it again to your heart
Got lost, in this game oh baby
Oops you (oops you) think that I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

Oops I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Ooh, baby, baby, oops, you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above 
I'm not that innocent

Oops I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Ooh, baby, baby, oops, you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above 
I'm not that innocent
