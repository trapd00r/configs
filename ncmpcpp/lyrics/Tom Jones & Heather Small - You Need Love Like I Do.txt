Well, well, well, seems like it was only yesterday
When mama told me, don't fall in love with the first girl that comes your way
She was pretty and nice and I took her fast and passed her by
Years have passed and moved like love's gonna give me a second try

More than loved than you first tells me you understand
Could it be your lovelife like mine, I need a girlfriend's hand

Well, you need love like I do, don't you
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you

(take it girl) I know it ain't fine and proper for a girl to talk this way
But I can't cope with this loneliness not one more damned on day
Everyday bringing up your clown to keeping my hopes of love
Judging from your silence, boy you must be in the same boat

Well, you need love like I do, don't you
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you
You need love like I do, don't you
It seems like I'm looking in the mirror, when I'm looking at you

I can't begin to tell the many nights I set down lonely
Come on, tell me girl, has it ever happened to you
I'm gonna tell you something and believe me, it ain't no joke
My lovelife is just like a sinking boat

I can understand a person beeing without money
You can show me the reason for a person to be without luck

Listen to me now, I'm a girl and you're a guy (yes it's true)
Come on naked and love and try (haha, yeah)

You need love like I do, don't you
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you

Finding true love is a dream everybody wants to come true
Can't you see it's up to us to make this dream come true

You need love like I do, don't you
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you
(Well, well) You need love like I do, don't you
It seems like I'm looking in the mirror, when I'm looking at you

Ain't it true, ain't it true, ain't it true
Ain't it true, ain't it true, yes it's so true
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well
You need love too

You need love like I do, don't you
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you
(Hey, hey) You need love like I do, don't you
It seems like I'm looking in the mirror, when I'm looking at you

You need love like I do, don't you
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you
You need love like I do, don't you
It seems like I'm looking in the mirrow, when I'm looking at you

Ain't it true girl
Well, I'm in love
I need love
And I need you
And I need you toooo.....au!
