(Intro - Spoken) 
Yo, I can't sing it 
I feel like singin 
I wanna fuckin'sing 
Cuz I'm happy 
Yeah, I'm happy 
Ha Ha 
I got my baby back 
Yo, check it out 

(Verse 1 - Sung) 
Some days I sit, starin'out the window 
Watchin'this world pass me by 
Sometimes I think theres nothin'to live for 
I almost break down and cry 

Somtimes I think I'm crazy 
I'm crazy, oh so crazy 
Why am I here, am I just wasting my time? 

But then I see my baby 
Suddenly I'm not crazy 
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes 

(Chorus) 
Somtimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders 
Everyone's leanin'on me 
Cuz sometimes it feels like the world's almost over 
But then she comes back to me 

(Verse 2 - Sung) 
My baby girl (Hailie laughs) keeps gettin'older 
I watch her grow up with pride 
People make jokes, cuz they don't understand me 
They just dont see my real side 

I act like shit don't phase me, 
Inside it drives me crazy 
My insecurities could eat me alive 

But then I see my baby 
Suddenly I'm not crazy 
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes 

(Chorus) 

(Verse 3 - Rapped) 
Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singing this song to my daughter 
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow something as long as my father 
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her 
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mum didn't want her 
Now you probly get this picture from my public persona 
That I'm a pistol-packing drug-addict who bags on his momma, 
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest 
Cuz there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' my soul, 
And just know that I grow colder the older I grow 
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold 
And this load is like the weight of the world 
And I think my neck is breaking should I just give up, 
Or try to live up to these expectations? 
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself, 
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin'hell 
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt 
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else 
But the years that I've wasted are nothing to the tears that I've tasted 
So here's what im facin: 
3 felonies, 6 years of probation 
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman 
I've taken bats to peoples backs, bent over backwards for this woman 
Man, I shoulda seen it comin, why'd I stick my penis up in? 
Woulda ripped the pre-nup up if I'd seen what she was fuckin 
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more 
I got my baby, baby the only lady that I adore, Hailie 
So sayonara, try tomorra, nice to know ya 
My baby's travelled back to the arms of her rightful owner 
And suddenly it seems that my shoulder blades have just shifted 
It's like the greatest gift you can get 
The weight has been lifted 

Now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders 
Everyone's leanin'on me 
Cuz my baby know's that her daddy's a soldier 
Nothin' can take her from me 

(Outro - Spoken) 
Woo! 
I told you I can't sing. 
Oh well, I tried 
Hailie, 'member when I said 
If you ever need anything, daddy will be right there? 
Well guess what? 
Daddy's here. 
And I ain't goin'nowhere baby 
I love you! (kiss)
