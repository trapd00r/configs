One way or another, I'm gonna find ya
I'm gonna get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
One way or another, I'm gonna win ya
I'm gonna get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya

One way or another, I'm gonna see ya
I'm gonna meet ya, meet ya, meet ya, meet ya
One day, maybe next week
I'm gonna meet ya, I'm gonna meet ya, I'll meet ya

I will drive past your house
And if the lights are all down
I'll see who's around

One way or another, I'm gonna find ya
I'm gonna get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
One way or another, I'm gonna win ya
I'll get ya, I'll get ya

One way or another, I'm gonna see ya
I'm gonna meet ya, meet ya, meet ya, meet ya
One day, maybe next week, I'm gonna meet ya
I'll meet ya, ahh

And if the lights are all out
I'll follow your bus downtown
See who's hangin' 'round

One way or another, I'm gonna lose ya
I'm gonna give you the slip
A slip of the hip for another
I'm gonna lose ya, I'm gonna trick ya, I'll trick ya

One way or another, I'm gonna lose ya
I'm gonna trick ya, trick ya, trick ya, trick ya
One way or another, I'm gonna lose ya
I'm gonna give you the slip

I walked down the mall
Stand over by the wall
Where I can see it all
Find out who ya call
Lead you to the supermarket checkouts
Some specials and rat food
Get lost in the crowd

One way or another, I'm gonna get ya
I'll get ya, I'll get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
(Where I can see it all, find out who ya call)
One way or another, I'm gonna get ya
I'll get ya, I'll get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
(Where I can see it all, find out who ya call)
One way or another, I'm gonna get ya
I'll get ya, I'll get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
(Where I can see it all, find out who ya call)
One way or another, I'm gonna get ya
I'll get ya, I'll get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
(Where I can see it all, find out who ya call)
One way or another, I'm gonna get ya
I'll get ya, I'll get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
(Where I can see it all, find out who ya call)
One way or another, I'm gonna get ya
I'll get ya, I'll get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
(Where I can see it all, find out who ya call)
One way or another
