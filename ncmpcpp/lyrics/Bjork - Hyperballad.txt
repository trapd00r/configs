We live on a mountain
Right at the top
There's a beautiful view
From the top of the mountain
Every morning I walk towards the edge
And throw little things off
Like car-parts, bottles and cutlery
Or whatever I find lying around.
It's become a habit
A way
To start the day

I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you
I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you

It's early morning
No-one is awake
I'm back at my cliff
Still throwing things off
I listen to the sounds they make
On their way down
I follow with my eyes 'til they crash
I imagine what my body would sound like
Slamming against those rocks
And when it lands
Will my eyes be closed or open?

I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you
I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you
I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you 
(Safe up here...Safe up here)
(Safe up here...Safe up here)
(Safe up here...Safe up here)
(Safe up here...Safe up here)
(Safe up here...Safe up here)
(Safe up here...Safe up here)
(Safe up here...Safe up here)
(Safe up here...Safe up here)
(Safe up here...Safe up here)
