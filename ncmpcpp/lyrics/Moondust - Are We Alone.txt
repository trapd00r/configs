Oooh...
Close to you (3x)

Suddenly you find yourself alone

Why do birds suddenly appear
Everytime you are near
Just like me they long to be
Close to you (3x)

Why do stars fall out from the sky
Everytime you walk by
Just like me they long to be
Close to you (3x)

Suddenly you find yourself alone

Half a minute!
Half a minute!

What is there to say when all the lovers slipped away in half a minute
There is always someone we can blame but in the end it’s just the same
Oh suddenly you find yourself alone

On the day that you were born the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moondust in your hair
And gold and starlight in your eyes so blue

That is why all the girls in town
Follow you, all around
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you (3x)
