Oh no-there's got to be a better way
Say it again
There's got to be a better way-yeah
What is it good for?

*War has caused unrest

Among the younger generation
Induction then destruction
Who wants to die?

War-huh
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
Say it again

War-huh
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
Yeah

War-I despise
'Cos it means destruction

Of innocent lives
War means tears
To thousands of mothers how
When their sons go off to fight
And lose their lives

I said
War-huh

It's an enemy of all mankind
No point of war
'Cos you're a man

*(Repeat)

Give it to me one time-now
Give it to me one time-now

War has shattered
Many young men's dreams
We've got no place for it today
They say we must fight to keep our freedom
But Lord, there's just got to be a better way

It ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
War
Friend only to the undertaker
War

War
War-Good God, ya'll

Now
Give it to me one time now
Now now
What is it good for?
