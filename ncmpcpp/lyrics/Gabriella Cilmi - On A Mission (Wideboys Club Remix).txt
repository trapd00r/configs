It's tough for me to make a move
And I know what I gotta do
Cause I got everything to prove
I got a plan I'm sticking to

The word is that I’m over doubt
But I don't let it get me down
I ain't nobody's push around
If they could only see me now

There's only one thing on my mind
And I am running out of time
I'm coming girls, so get out of the way

I am a woman on a mission whoa
Nothing can stop me, I'm stronger than ever
I'm gunna see this through
I am a woman on a mission whoa
Whatever it takes I will do what I gotta do

I'm gunna lay it on the line
I won't give up without a fight
Cos I can see the finish line
Wont stop until I think your mine

So read the writing on the wall
I'm ready and I'm standing tall
Some people think they know it all
I guess I'll have to show 'em all

There's only one thing on my mind
And I am running out of time
I'm coming girls, so get out of the way

I am a woman on a mission whoa
Nothing can stop me, I'm stronger than ever
I'm gunna see this through
I am a woman on a mission whoa
Whatever it takes I will do what I gotta do

Stand aside cos I'm on a mission
I'm on fire, there's no competition
You can't blame me I got intuition
And I never miss a trick just like a magician

You don't need cash, you don't need permission
If you think I'm scared, you must be tripping
Foot on gas, Key in ignition
Can't stop now cos I'm on a mission

I am a woman on a mission whoa
Nothing can stop me, I'm stronger than ever
I'm gunna see this through
I am a woman on a mission whoa
Whatever it takes I will do what I gotta

I never give up, I never give up, I never give up
I'm on a mission
I never give up, I never give up,
I'm gunna see this through

I never give up, I never give up, I never give up
I'm on a mission
Whatever it takes, I will do what I gotta do
