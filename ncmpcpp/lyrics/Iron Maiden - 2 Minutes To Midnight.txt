Kill for gain or shoot to maim
But we don't need a reason
The Golden Goose is on the loose
And never out of season.
Blackened pride still burns inside
This shell of bloody treason
Here's my gun for a barrel of fun
For the love of living death.

The killer's breed or the Demon's seed,
The glamour, the fortune and the pain,
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain,
Don't you pray for my soul anymore.

2 minutes to midnight,
The hands that threaten doom.
2 minutes to midnight,
To kill the unborn in the womb.

The blind men shout let the creatures out
We'll show the unbelievers,
The Napalm screams of human flames
Of a prime time Belsen feast...YEAH!
As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy,
We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies.

The killer's breed or the Demon's seed,
The glamour, the fortune and the pain,
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain,
Don't you pray for my soul anymore.

2 minutes to midnight,
The hands that threaten doom.
2 minutes to midnight,
To kill the unborn in the womb.

The body bags and little rags of children torn in two,
And the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on you
As the madmen play on words and make us all dance to their song,
To the tune of starving millions, to make a better kind of gun.

The killer's breed or the Demon's seed,
The glamour, the fortune and the pain,
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain,
Don't you pray for my soul anymore.

2 minutes to midnight,
The hands that threaten doom.
2 minutes to midnight,
To kill the unborn in the womb.
