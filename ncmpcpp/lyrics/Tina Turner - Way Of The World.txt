Baby, I need a hand to hold tonight 
And one bright star to remind me 
How dear is this life 
And baby, I've never known anyone like you 
There's something very special about you 
I can't imagine living without you 

It's the way of the world and its motion 
And no ocean can keep us apart 
When the moment is right and you're holding me tight 
You capture the beat of my heart 
In my heart there's s fire always burning 
And there isn't a thing I can't do 
I'm resigned to the fact that there's no turning back 
And I'll never regret loving you 

Baby, I will go anywhere you need 
As long as you're there beside me 
Baby, that's all I need 
Hold me, hold me and never let me go 
I'm always gonna care about you 
I never wanna be without you 

It's the way of the world and its motion 
And no ocean can keep us apart 
When the moment is right and you're holding me tight 
You capture the beat of my heart 
In my heart there's s fire always burning 
And there isn't a thing I can't do 
I'm resigned to the fact that there's no turning back 
And I'll never regret loving you 

You're everything I believe in 
So don't ever lose the feeling 
Don't ever lose the feeling
