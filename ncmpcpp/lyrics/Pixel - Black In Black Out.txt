Back in black 

 I hit the sack 

 I've been too long I'm glad to be back          [I bet you know I'm...] 

 Yes, I'm let loose 

 From the noose 

 That's kept me hanging about 

 I've been looking at the sky 

 'Cause it's gettin' me high 

 Forget the hearse 'cause I never die 

 I got nine lives 

 Cat's Eyes 

 Abusin' every one of them and running wild 

  

 CHORUS: 

 'Cause I'm back 

 Yes, I'm back 

 Well, I'm back 

 Yes, I'm back 

 Well, I'm back, back 

 (Well) I'm back in black 

 Yes, I'm back in black 

  

 Back in the back 

 Of a Cadillac 

 Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack 

 Yes, I'm in a bang 

 With a gang 

 They've got to catch me if they want me to hang 

 Cause I'm back on the track 

 And I'm beatin' the flack 

 Nobody's gonna get me on another rap 

 So look at me now 

 I'm just makin' my play 

 Don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way 

  

 CHORUS 

  

 Well, I'm back, Yes I'm back 

 Well, I'm back, Yes I'm back 

 Well, I'm back, back 

 Well I'm back in black 

 Yes I'm back in black 

  

 hooo yeah 

 Ohh yeah 

 Yes I am 

 Oooh yeah, yeah Oh yeah 

 Back in now 

 Well I'm back, I'm back 

 Back, I'm back 

 Back, I'm back 

 Back, I'm back 

 Back, I'm back 

 Back 

 Back in black 

 Yes I'm back in black 

  

 Out of the sight
