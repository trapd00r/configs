&lt;O'Shea!  O'Shea!
Get your ass in here, boy
You hear me calling you?
O'Shea!&gt;

When I was young I used to hang with the seventh graders
Little bad motherfucker playing Space Invaders
Fucking with the girls in the fourth grade
Either feeling on they butts or pulling on they braids
Walking with the schoolhouse bully
By doing that, I had a lot of pull, G
Cheating on tests, making a mess
Cussing like a sailor at recess
It must a been a half moon
Cause you'll catch me running out the little girls' bathroom
Chewing on Good and Plenties
Got my gamble on at lunch pitching pennies
Yo I was living like the class clown
Pulling all the hokes, making all the jokes man
When you young it's hard to see
That it's wrong throwing rocks at the RTD
Popping out your window with a BB gun
Better yet knocking on your door and run
Playing hide-and-go-get-it for a little stank
Even though I was still shooting blanks
As soon as the dark hit
I was stealing candy out the corner market
Until I got my ass whipped
Cause I was ten years old, doing dumb shit

Thirteen, that's how old I was
When my jimmy started getting a little peach fuzz
And I was looking at any butt and ass
Me and my homies started cutting class
Going up to the high school
Looking for any bitch I could lie to
Tell em I was older than I really was
Smoked my first joint and got really buzzed
That's what a mack's made of
But when I got my first piece of pussy I fell in love
Hard as a rock the long way
And then I put the rubber on the wrong way
But I still gotta have it
Overexcited and fucking like a jackrabbit
Goddamn I was hot
A virgin but I still knew how to lay pipe
Even though the hoe worked me
I still knocked the boots from here to Albuquerque
Then the shit got strange money
I started shaking and jimmy felt funny
Then the nut came gushing
I jumped up got dressed and start pushing
Cause I thought the bitch broke my dick
Cause I was still young doing dumb shit

At 17 got my first Volkswagon
And mastered the life-long art of dragging
To the women in college
Hung out with the OG's and got some street knowledge
Breaking in cars and all that
Hitting punk fools with a baseball bat
Fucking at a real fast rate
Til they said that I might not graduate
Then I said fuck the dumb shit
Cause Pops'll fuck me up quick
If things continued
So I start rapping about shit I been through
And I got real good
Now I look at all the kids in the neighborhood
Trying to be baby macks
Doing shit that I did seven years back
Going through a stage
But before they can grow up they on the front page
And they mommas is having a fit
Cause they died young doing dumb shi
