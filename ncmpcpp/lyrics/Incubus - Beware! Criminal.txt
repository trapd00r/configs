You crawl in bed, it's 3 a.m.
You smell of wine and cigarettes
A butterfly under the glass, you are beautiful
But you're not going anywhere

We do the same thing every night
I swear I've heard this song before
A swimmer who has seen a shark
I'd really be more wary of the water

You came, you saw, you conquered everyone
I'm left here guessing, oh, what went wrong?
Yeah, I'm down but not out, and far from done
Hey-o, beware criminal

A prism with an intellect
You show your light selectively
You stole my glow, a seasoned thief
The blacks of my eyes are turning into opals

Today, I'll walk
There's nothing here left for me but empty promises
And the thought of all the things
I'm never getting back

You came, you saw, you conquered everyone
I'm left here bleeding, oh what went wrong?
Yeah, I'm down but not out, and far from done
Hey-o, beware
Beware criminal
Criminal
Criminal

Did you think, did you think I wouldn't notice?
Did you think, did you think, did you really think I wouldn't care?
Did you think, did you think I wouldn't notice?
Did you think, did you think, did you really think, yeah

You came, you saw, you conquered
And I'm left here bleeding, oh, what went wrong?
Yeah, I'm down but not out, and far from done
Hey-o, beware criminal
