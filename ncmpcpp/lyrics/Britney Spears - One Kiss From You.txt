I'm dreaming of one kiss from you
A love long and true
We'll go on and on and on

I don't wanna hear that I'm too young
To know it's love that makes me feel this way
'Cause I don't have to feel the heat of the sun
To know it's shining on me every day
When it's warm outside
And the look in your eyes
Is longing to show me the way
I don't want to wait

(CHORUS:)
Just one kiss from you, and suddenly
I see the road laid out in front of me
You give me strength, you give me hope
And when you hold me in your arms
You make me whole
And I don't know just what I would do
Without one kiss from you

I don't wanna hear my time will come
When it feels like it's already here
We should learn to walk before we run
But why go anywhere when you're so near
'Cause when I reach out to you
So sad and confused
And feeling like I could cry
You dry my eyes

(Repeat CHORUS)

I'm dreaming of one kiss from you
A love long and true
We'll go on and on and on
I'm looking for one kiss goodnight
To last all my life
On and on and on

(Repeat CHORUS)

I'm looking for one kiss goodnight
To last all my life
