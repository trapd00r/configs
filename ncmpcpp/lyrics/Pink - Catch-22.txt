Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Pink Airlines. We hope your
flight is enjoyable and our flight attendants are here to insure your ride is
as pleasant as possible. Seat backs and tray tables must be in the upright
position during the take-off and landing. All carry-on luggage must be stowed
in an over-head compartment or under the seat in front of you...

Waiting on a ticket
'Cause you're looking for the ride
You're feeling on top
'Cause you're flying through the sky
You wanna have your cake
And you wanna eat it too
Everybody's always pointing fingers at you
You're damned if you do
You're damned if you don't
We're always doing all the things
That we say we won't

[CHORUS]:
Here we go
We're riding on a whim
Connecting with a rendezvous
Here we go
We're jumping off the wings
We're going round in circles
It's a catch 22
Yes, we're flying round in circles
It's a catch 22
yes were rocking round in circles
it's the catch 22

[SPOKEN]:
If you are seated in an emergency exit aisle and feel as though you are unable
or unwilling to assist in case of an emergency, please notify a flight
attendant immediately. All eletrical equipment, including cell phones, 2-way
pagers, portable CD players, laptops, etc. should remain in the off position
until the pilot notifies us that we areat a safe flying altitude of 10,000 ft.

Looking from the outside
You're always looking in
You think you fixed the problem
'Til it comes right back again
And life seems like a trap
You're trying to get out
You're searching for you cheese
'Cause you feel like mighty mouse
You're damned if you don't
You're damned if you do
You've seen all the signs
But you haven't got a clue

Here we go
We're riding on a whim
Connecting with a rendezvous
Here we go
We're jumping off the wings
We're going round in circles
It's a catch 22
Yes, we're flying round in circles
It's a catch 22
yes were rocking round in circles
it's the catch 22

You are in for the ride of you life

Here we go
We're riding on a whim
Connecting with a rendezvous
Here we go
We're jumping off the wings
We're going round in circles
It's a catch 22
Yes, we're flying round in circles
It's a catch 22
yes were rocking round in circles
it's the catch 22

[SPOKEN]:
We realize you have many choices and on behalf of Pink Airlines, we'd like to
thank you for flying with us. We hope you have a wonderful stay wherever your
destination may be, and remember be careful when retrieving your items, as
during the flight they may have shifted and might fall on you or your
neighboor's head and knock you the fuck out...

Here we go
We're riding on a whim
Connecting with a rendezvous
Here we go
We're jumping off the wings
We're going round in circles
It's a catch 22
Yes, we're flying round in circles
It's a catch 22
yes were rocking round in circles
