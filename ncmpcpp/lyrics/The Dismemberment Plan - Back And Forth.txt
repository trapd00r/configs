There's a kind of music that reminds me of you 
It's all clear expensive drinks and shiny shirts 
And the click of heels as they descend from the taxi 
Like the first foot on the moon, oh, and it glows with ache 
And if it hits me right it's almost too much to take 
And it's got right angle razor thin lines 
That turn and swerve like perfect sines 
As we dress to the nines in an 
Attempt to leave it all behind 
In a search of the moment between the seconds where 
Everything is just fine 
That silver thread imbedded deep within our spines 
And I used to be kind of weird about this 
A fear of dependence on a guilty gilt-edged 
Hedged transcendence that makes us lairs 
And tense when we look down and realize 
That nothing really suspends us 
But it was never just another Saturday night 
Not with you in attendance 
So throw your hands in the air 
And wave them like you just don't care 
It's on a whim; it's on a dare 
To shrug away what we can't bear 
And we're going back and forth 
And back and forth and back and forth and back 
We're going back and forth 
And back and forth and back and forth and back 
And it's a deep blue see-through membrane that protects us 
It connects us, a pulsing cellophane 
Party-train skein that helps us and 
Envelopes and keeps us locked inside 
Forever and ever along for the ride 
And we're moving through a phosphorescent gel 
A semi-solid self-lit ocean and it's a funny notion, isn't it? 
Yeah, but I'm kinda digging it 
And it's rigged and isn't nearly so big 
And it speaks only of its own 
Perpetual near miss 
Like the uncertain memory 
Of a stranger's mistaken kiss 
And faces slide by in glowing shadows 
Like snowbound ghosts that go up and down 
In epileptic shivers and negative radioactive slivers 
In a landscape of endless dull glitter 
And a taste in my mouth so sweet, yet so bitter 
And we exhaust ourselves trying to get there 
Somebody scream—all right 
We'll try to fill the echoless night 
So fasten up and hold tight 
We can't give up without a fight 
And we're going back and forth 
And back and forth and back and forth and back 
We're going back and forth 
And back and forth and back and forth and back 
So in the end, whatever, we die, we dissolve 
Equations unbalanced, riddles unsolved 
And we were never connected or involved 
Except for the intersections and crazy mathematics 
With no time and no space and no schedule and no place 
And we pass right through it without a trace 
And sometimes that music drifts through my car 
On a spring night when anything is possible 
And I close my eyes and I not my head 
And I wonder how you been and I count to a hundred and ten 
Because you'll always be my hero, even if I never see you again
