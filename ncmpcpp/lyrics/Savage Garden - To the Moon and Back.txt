Send "To the Moon and Back" Ringtone to your Cell She's taking her time making up the reasons
To justify all the hurt inside, guess she knows
From the smiles and the look in their eyes
Everyone's got a theory about the bitter one, they're saying

Mama never loved her much and
Daddy never keeps in touch
That's why she shies away from human affection, but

Somewhere in a private place
She packs her bags for outer space
And now she's waiting for the right kind of pilot to come

And she'll say to him (She's saying)

[Chorus]
I would fly you to the moon and back
If you'll be if you'll be my baby
I've got a ticket for a world where we belong
So would you be my baby 

She can't remember a time when she felt needed
If love was red then she was color-blind, all her friends
They've been tried for treason
And crimes that were never defined 

She's saying, love is like a barren place
And reaching out for human faith is
Is like a journey I just don't have a map for
So baby gonna take a dive and push the shift to overdrive
Send a signal that she's hanging all her hopes on the stars 

What a pleasant dream (just saying)

[Chorus: x2]

Mama never loved her much
And daddy never keeps in touch
That's why she shies away from human affection

But somewhere in a private place
She packs her bags for outer space
And now she's waiting for the right kind of pilot to come

And she'll say to him (she's saying)

[Chorus: x2]
