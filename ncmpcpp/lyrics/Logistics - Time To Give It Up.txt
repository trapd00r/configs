Always said I would know where to find love, 
Always thought I'd be ready and strong enough, 
But some times I just felt I could give up. 
But you came and changed my whole world now, 
I'm somewhere I've never been before. 
Now I see, what love means. 

[Chorus] 
It's so unbelievable, 
And I don't want to let it go, 
Something so beautiful, 
Flowing down like a waterfall. 
I feel like you've always been, 
Forever a part of me. 
And it's so unbelievable to finally be in love, 
Somewhere I'd never thought I'd be. 

In my heart, in my head, it's so clear now, 
Hold my hand you've got nothing to fear now, 
I was lost and you've rescued me some how-. 
I'm alive, I'm in love you complete me, 
And I've never been here before. 
Now I see, what love means. 

[Chorus]

When I think of what I have, and this chance I nearly lost, 
I cant help but break down, and cry. 
Ohh yeah, break down and cry. 

[Chorus]

Now I see, what love means
