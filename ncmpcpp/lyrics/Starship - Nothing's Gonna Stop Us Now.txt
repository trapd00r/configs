Lookin' in your eyes
I see a paradise
This world that I found
Is too good to be true

Standin' here beside you
Want so much to give you
This love in my heart
That I'm feelin' for you

Let 'em say we're crazy
I don't care 'bout that
Put your hand in my hand
Baby, don't ever look back

Let the world around us
Just fall apart
Baby, we can make it 
If we're heart to heart

And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us now 
Oh, whoa

I'm so glad I found you
I'm not gonna lose you
Whatever it takes
I will stay here with you

Take it to the good times
See it through the bad times
Whatever it takes
Is what I'm gonna do

Let 'em say we're crazy
What do they know
Put your arms around me
Baby, don't ever let go

Let the world around us
Just fall apart
Baby, we can make it 
If we're heart to heart

And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now

And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us

Ooh, all that I need is you
All that I ever need
And all that I want to do
Is hold you forever ever and ever, hey

And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now

And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us

We can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
Nothing's gonna stop us

And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us now

We can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now

World runs out of lovers
Nothing's gonna stop us
We'll still have each other

We can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
