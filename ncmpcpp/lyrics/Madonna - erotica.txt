My name is Dita
I'll be your mistress tonight

I'd like to put you in a trance

If I take you from behind
Push myself into your mind
When you least expect it
Will you try to reject it

If I'm in charge
And I treat you like a child
Will you let yourself go wild
Let my mouth go where it wants to

Give it up 
Do as I say
Give it up
and let me have my way
I'll give you love 
I'l hit you like a truck
I'll give you love
I'll teach you how to

uuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhh
I'd like to put you in a trance
All over

Chorus

Erotic,Erotic
Put your hands all over my body
Erotic,Erotic
Put your hands all over my body
Erotic,Erotic
Put your hands all over my body
Erotic,Eotic

Once you put your hand in the flame
It will never be the same
Theres a certain satisfaction 
and a little bit of pain

I can see you understand
I Can tell you're the same
If You're Afraid, Well Rise Above
I Only Hurt The Ones I Love

Give It Up
Do As I Say
Give It Up
And Let Me Have My Way
I'll Give You Love
I'll Hit You Like A Truck
I'll Give You Love
I'll Teach You How To
UUUUUUUUUUUUHHHHHHHHHH

I'd Like To Put You In A Trance
All Over

Put Your Hands All Over My Body
Eroic , Erotic
Put Your Hands All Over My Body
Erotic , Erotic
Put Your Hands All Over My Body
Erotic , Erotic

What Pain Is
