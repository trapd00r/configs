Eminem: Shady, that's me
Mr. Eon: Iron Mic Trilogy
Erik Sermon: Back with the flyest material
Eminem: Sh-Sh-Shady, that that, that's me
Mr. Eon: Iron Mic Trilogy
Erik Sermon: Back with the funky beats

Mr. Eon:
Packin' this third eye vs. you, a cyclopse
They trade in their high tops for nice sized white rocks
Words in my right, they pass my left ear
It's solid decked out, write the books for next year
Bear this grenade you got stun like virgin
Who that cat splurgin' instead of rehearsin'?
Tough guy, DJ Travi your high rise
Lookin' more like Ronald then the fuckin' fry guys
Go on uptown, fucking señoritas
In Taco Bell screaming, "Viva gorditas!"
Bring all your dogs, I give 'em rabies
They never had a chance, I might chew up all their babies (waaah)
Got Pope John Paul the Second prayin' to Satan
Have your vegan girlfriend cooking up bacon
I'm obituite with that shit that you hit
Smoke my spliff with ya 'cause mine a ?

Eminem:
My nine is limpin', ya six deep when I spray rounds
Hit you with 12 shots in mid-air and four more on the way down
The eight straight strays to a kid's hair on the playground
You lay down on a stretcher (Don't get carried away now!)
No pun intended, snapped out of your whip
And leave it unattended before I whip out this gun and end it
Unless you want it dented with bullet holes any minute
'Cause I can leave your Infinite full of those even if someone's in it
Snap the airbag, hit the corner and park it
You cornered a market, I got her tied up in the chair and gag
Bitches get smacked and grabbed by the hair and dragged
Like cave women, while I'm grave diggin' with Marilyn Mans

Mr. Eon:
If you got a bowl of hash, better cash it
Dollar signs flashin', I'ma take your last hit

Eminem:
And if you're spittin' whack shit on the microphone
I'ma snatch it outta your hand so fast I'm gonna detach it

Mr. Eon:
So if you got a bowl of hash, you better cash it
Dollar signs flashin', I'ma take your last hit

Eminem:
I'm flabbergasted off two tabs of acid
Threw my baby's mother in a knapsack and latched it

Mr. Eon:
Yo, yo, "Eon's whack now," how you dig that?
Couldn't get on my record if you were street rap
Get the greater rate with these rhymes I be totin'
Let's go back online and jerk off on your modem
I got stupid mucus from these loose lips
My loose leaf leave your whole persona weak
To the point that you stand up on your feet, best retreat
Best go back in time and steal my whole seed
The quickening, did a briss at the christening
I'm exercisin', to uplifting the foot stage
This thing's the nicest, I keep tellin' you
What the fuck this guy on the corner been sellin' you?
(Here buy this)

Eminem:
I'm e-mailing you at the wrong website
Mispelling you, break you and put the fear of Hell in you
Escape Bellevue you, stuffed the nurse in a purse
Disperse like I added too many words in a verse
Slim Shady, a perverted version at birth
Driving off, leaving the murdered virgin at church
The first person who searchin' the Earth for the motherfucker
That pulled the plug when they should of alerted the surgeon first
You throwin' curves and hit with your own words
Leave me alone bitch, I get on my own nerves
And if I don't got two balls and a middle finger to throw up
I'm takin' off both shoes and stickin' each middle toe up (fuck y'all)

Mr. Eon:
If y'all got a bowl of hash, better cash it
Dollar signs flashin', I'ma take your last hit (gimme that)

Eminem:
And if you're spittin' whack shit on the microphone
I'ma snatch it outta your hand so fast I'm gonna detach it

Mr. Eon:
So if you got a bowl of hash, you better cash it
Dollar signs flashin', I'ma take your last hit

Eminem:
I'm flabbergasted off two tabs of acid
Threw my baby's mother in a hatch-back and latched it

Eminem:
Any disease out there, I'm willing to catch it
Slim Shady, all praises to the High and Mighty

Eminem: Slim Shady, naughty rotten rhymer
Mr. Eon: Mr. Eon, illest rhyme dropper
Eminem Slim Shady, naughty rotten rhymer
Mr. Eon: Mr. Eon, illest rhyme dropper
Eminem: Slim Shady, naughty rotten rhymer
Mr. Eon: Mr. Eon, illest rhyme dropper
