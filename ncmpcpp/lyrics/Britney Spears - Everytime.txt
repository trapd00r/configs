Notice me, take my hand 
Why are we strangers when 
Our love is strong 
Why carry on without me 

Everytime I try to fly, I fall 
Without my wings, I feel so small 
I guess I need you, baby 
And everytime I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, it's haunting me 
I guess I need you, baby 

I make believe that you are here 
It's the only way I see clear 
What have I done 
You seem to move on easy 

And everytime I try to fly, I fall 
Without my wings, I feel so small 
I guess I need you, baby 
And everytime I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, you're haunting me 
I guess I need you, baby 

I may have made it rain 
Please forgive me 
My weakness caused you pain 
And this song's my sorry 

At night I pray 
That soon your face will fade away 

And everytime I try to fly, I fall 
Without my wings, I feel so small 
I guess I need you, baby 
And everytime I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, you're haunting me 
I guess I need you, baby
