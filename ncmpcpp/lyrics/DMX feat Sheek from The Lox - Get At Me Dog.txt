What must I go through to show you shit is real 
And I ain't really never gave a fuck how niggaz feel 
Rob then I steal, not cause I want to cause I have to 
And don't make me show you with the Magnum 
If you don't know by now then you slippin 
I'm on some bullshit thats got me jackin, niggaz flippin 
I got my man and them stay pretty like I'ma stay shitty 
Crimey it's all for the money is you wit me 
Hit the bitches, went out I could make the crime 
And when it's on we transform like Optimus Prime 
I'll form the head, roll out let's make it happen 
If we ain't gonna get it wit them we'll take the cap down 
Bust it off, gust it off on the softest niggaz 
Money with the biggest mouth, yo let's rob this nigga 
A novice nigga never made a sound 
Breath too fuckin hard like you gettin bust down

Cause they deserve it; with money got murdered 
They know we died slow if they heard it 
The nigga there blew up the spot a while

And the stacks will light up, will fuck the night up 
blow everything in sight up

What makes you think, you wasn't able to stand 
I got shit that'll disable a man with the wave of a hand 
The days are longer and seems like I'm wastin time 
I've got a lot of dreams but I'm not really chasin mine 
I suck it all up like a sicka fly 
Cause nowadays gettin' by, catchin ???, an occasional meal and

Blood stains and chalk, cause yo man couldn't walk 
After the talk, heard him out at 1133 of New York

And it's gon' take all these niggaz in the rap game 
to barely move me, cause when I blow shit up

Ah, you know I don't know how to act

"Protected by viper, stand back"
