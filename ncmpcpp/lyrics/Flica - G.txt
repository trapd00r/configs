Send "Glam Slam" Ringtone to your Cell This thing we got - it's alive!
It seems 2 transcend the physical
One touch and I'm satisfied
Must be a dream it's so magical

Glam Slam thank U ma'am
U really make my day
Glam Slam thank U ma'am
I pray U always stay

I know I hold U 2 tight
But I just can't seem 2 get close enough (I want to hold U)
I want 2 hold U every night
I'm so horny and U're the star

Glam Slam thank U ma'am
U really make my day
Glam Slam thank U ma'am
I pray U always stay

Heavy feather, flicka nipple
Baby scam water ripple
I don't understand
It means I love U
Come a butterfly straight on your skin
U go 4 me and I come again
Glam Slam, thank U ma'am
Sun is risen, moon is gone
Soda fizzin' on the lawn
Come a butterfly straight on your skin
Glam Slam

Glam Slam, thank U ma'am
U really make my day

This thing we got - it's alive!
It seems 2 transcend the physical
One touch and I'm satisfied (ooh, baby)
Must be a dream it's so magical

Glam Slam thank U ma'am
U really make my day
Glam Slam thank U ma'am
I pray U always stay

Glam Slam
U will always stay
U will always stay

It's all right, it's OK
