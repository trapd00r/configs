Eminem
I ain't gonna eat, I ain't gonna sleep
Ain't gonna breathe, till I see, what I wanna see
And what I wanna see, is you go to sleep in the dirt
Permanently, you just being hurt, this ain't gonna work

For me, it just wouldn't be sufficient enough
'Cause we are just gonna be enemies
As long as we breathe, I don't ever see either of us
Coming to terms, where we can agree

There ain't gonna be no reason speakin' wit' me
You speak on my seed, then me, no speakin' Englais
So we gonna beef and keep on beefin', unless
You're gonna agree to meet with me in the flesh

And settle this face to face and you're gonna see
A demon unleashed in me that you've never seen
And you're gonna see this gangsta pee on himself
I see you D-12 and thanks but me need no help

Me do this one all by my lonely, I don't need fifteen of my homies
When I see you, I'm seeing you, me and you only
We never met but best believe you gon' know me
When I'm this close to see you exposed as phony

Come on, bitch, show me, pick me up, throw me
Lift me up, hold me just like you told me
You was gonna do, that's what I thought, you're pitiful
I'm rid of you, all you, Ja, you'll get it too

Now go to sleep bitch
Die, mothafucka, die (Uh)
Time's up bitch close ya eyes
Go to sleep, bitch (What?)
Why are you still alive
How many times I gotta say, close ya eyes

And go to sleep bitch (What?)
Die motherfucker die
Bye bye, motherfucker, bye bye
Go to sleep bitch (What?)
Why are you still alive?
Why, die motherfucker, ah, ah, ah
Go to sleep bitch

Obie Trice
We got you niggaz, nervous on purpose
To hurt your focus, you's not MC's, you's worthless
You's not them G's, you's a circus, you's no appeal, please
You's curtains you use words cool heard slurred in two thousand third

You's purpin', you's no threat, who's ya servin'
We lyrically oughta bury you beneath the dirt when
You fuck with a label overseein' the Earth
Shady muthafucka, O. Trice's birth

And as I mold, I become a curse
So we can put down the verse, take it to the turf
Cock and squeeze and he who reach the hearse is he who
Depicts fiction in his verse

And as I breathe, and you be deceased
The world believe you deceived just to speak
You's not the streets, you's the deaths

Use not your chest nigga, use a vest
Before two's choose ya rest, you chose death
Six feet deep, nigga, that's the depth

Now go to sleep bitch
Die, mothafucka, die (Uh)
Time's up bitch close ya eyes
Go to sleep, bitch (What?)
Why are you still alive
How many times I gotta say, close ya eyes

And go to sleep bitch (What?)
Die motherfucker die
Bye bye, motherfucker, bye bye
Go to sleep bitch (What?)
Why are you still alive?
Why, die motherfucker, ah, ah, ah
Go to sleep bitch

DMX
Hey dog, I'ma walk like a beast, talk like the streets
I'ma stay blazin' New York wit' the heat
Stalk on the beat, walk wit' my feet
Understand my pain, the rain ain't sweet

Peep how I'm moving, peep where I'm going
Shit don't seep, then sleep not knowin'
But I'ma keep growing, getting larger than life
Easy going with the same one, that started the fight

He be knowing how dog get, when dog gon' bite
Tried to show him the dog shit, it's dog for life
Grand champ, and my Blood Line is tight
'Cause it's all good, it's all right

Niggas tried to holla, but couldn't holla back
Now they gots to swallow, everything in the sac
Blood Line and we can go track for track
Damn dog, why did you have to do them niggas like that?

Now go to sleep bitch
Die, mothafucka, die (Uh)
Time's up bitch close ya eyes
Go to sleep, bitch (What?)
Why are you still alive
How many times I gotta say, close ya eyes

And go to sleep bitch (What?)
Die motherfucker die
Bye bye, motherfucker, bye bye
Go to sleep bitch (What?)
Why are you still alive?
Why, die motherfucker, ah, ah, ah
Go to sleep bitch

All you motherfuckers, take that
Here, take this too, bitch, uh, uh, uh, uh, wahoo
We're killin' all you motherfuckers dead, all you
Fake ass gangsters, no more press, no more press

Rot, motherfuckers, rot
Decay, in the dirt, bitch
In the motherfucking dirt
Die nameless, bitch, die nameless, no more fame
Ahh, ha, ha, ha, ha
Yo X, come on man, Obie, let's go, ha ha
