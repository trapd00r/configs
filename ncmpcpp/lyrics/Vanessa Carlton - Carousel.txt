For all you broken hearted lovers lost,
Go find another one.
Cause you know time won't wait and you'll be late;
White rabbits on the run.

It's hard to know what's good for you;
You know she'll let you down.
But the fever breaks when it's too much to take
So you can put your weapons down.

And all you'll hear is the music;
And beauty stands before you;
And love comes back around again,
It's a carousel, my friend.

It's never too late to change the pace
When days creep up on you.
But the goodness is something you don't have to chase,
Cause it's following you...

And all you'll hear is the music;
And beauty stands before you;
And love comes back around again,
It's a carousel, my friend.

I thought I heard your voice in the thunder,
It's the owl casting spells that we're under;
I thought I heard your voice in the thunder,
It's the owl casting spells that we're under;

I thought I heard your voice in the thunder,
It's the owl casting spells that we're under;
I thought I heard your voice in the thunder,
It's the owl casting spells that we're under;
Under...

And all I hear is the music;
And beauty stands before me;
And love comes back around again,
It's a carousel, my friend-

It's in the music;
And beauty stands before you;
And love comes back around again,
It's a carousel, a carousel,
It's a carousel, my friend.

Time won't wait, so don't be late;
White rabbits on the run.
