[Royce] Yo if it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothin to strip
[Em] If it wasn't for a wrist, I'd have nothin to slit
If it wasn't for the shrooms, I'd have nothin to chew
[Royce] Yo..
[both] I'm just xxxxxx with you, cause I got nothin to do

[Eminem]
I am bored!!!!!
I came in the diner with skateboarders, and placed orders
Ate hors d'oeuvres, and hit the waiter with plate warmers *crash sound*
Let you inhale the glock smell, while I'm rippin your wallet offÂ�
And slippin a Molotov in your Cocktail (take that)
Burnin your contracts, punch your A&R in the face *punch sound*
Smash his glasses and turn em to contacts
I'm on some shook shit, if it's missin I took it (whoops!)
Nurse look at this straightjacket, it's crooked!
I go to jail and murder you from a cell
Put a knife in an envelope and have you stabbed in the mail (FedEx)
So how do you describe someone, with a decapitated headÂ�
When the rest of his body's still alive RUNNIN?

[Royce]
Comin with five gunmen, waitin to do a drive-by
So when you see the black 500 (what?) hide from it
For every hundred MC's rhymin about birds
Only about two-thirds'd really set it without words
Yo you ain't a thug, I can make you xxxxx up
Pick the fifth up, cock, spit, you would swear it's rainin slugs (what?)
I'm the hottest xxxx in the industry (uh)
I got every thug on the block that get a wind of me defendin me
You lack class and respect, get a direct backblast
The Bad and Evil mad rap, I cover the Bad half
You know how a thug in this shit'll end up
Spit a round, lift your chin up, you get hit, ten down and ten up (what?)
I take it if you run your mouth, then you wanna get sent up
Heat it up, you be leakin blood and spittin phlegm up
Now we rivals, cause of a small name or title
You stepped, got devoured and left with a flower and bible

*yawns* Forget a chorus -- my metaphors are so complicatedÂ�
It takes six minutes to get applause (yay)
And by the time you all catch on, I'ma end your careerÂ�
And walk away with the whole floor so you have nothin to fall back on!
I'll throw you off of ten floors .. *AHHHHHHH*
Pull a xxxxxx headache outta my head, and put it in yours (take this)
I'm indoors, waitin for this acid to seep in my skin pores
To go outdoors and do some in-stores
This xxxxx wanted to blow me, I said, "It oughta happen.
You swallow xxx bitch?" "No, but I brought a napkin"
Gettin skullie while I'm autographin
Got my daughter laughin cause I sent her mother Withewater raftin
I'm not a fact, I'ma proven fear
Mr. Rogers blocked up my U-haul screamin,Â�
"Wait, wait, wait.. you ain't movin here!"
Lorena Bobbitt, c'mere, want a souveneir?
I've been high as xxxxx since I was a juvi-neer
Juvenile? Same difference -- I need some 'caineÂ�
Cause I ain't sniffed since I woke up the seven slain infants
(Oh my God!) Brain implants and they say there's a slim chance
I won't stay the same cause I traded brains with a chimpanz'

[Royce]
Walkin in swamp water with an M-16, out for the blood
Shove a gun in the mouth of a thug
To break braces, you say grace and make faces
I'll display hate and break you in eight places (what?)
Take paces, turn around draw in a standoff
Precise aim, icin my fame, blowin your hand off
Dancin with the Devil leadin - I won't die, I'm never leavin (what?)
I pledge allegiance to forever breathin
Street niggaz with nuts, what? My meat's bigger (what?)
Fake-ass thugs with toy guns and cheap triggers
With a deathwish, thinkin I'm the nigga to mess with
Let the tech lift, direct chest hit, melt your necklace
For instance, you just a henchmen, on tough soil (what?)
A follower never had heart, he just loyal
Thugs is glass doors, I see through em, put the heat to em
Be careful you might get what you ask for
