This will never end 'cause I want more
More, give me more, give me more

This will never end 'cause I want more
More, give me more, give me more

If I had a heart I could love you
If I had a voice I would sing
After the night when I wake up
I'll see what tomorrow brings

If I had a voice I would sing

Dangling feet from window frame
Will I ever ever reach the floor?
More, give me more, give me more

Crushed and filled with all I found
Underneath and inside 
Just to come around
More, give me more, give me more

If I had a voice I would sing
