Don't waste your touch, you won't feel anything
Or were you sent to save me?
I've thought too much, you won't find anything
Worthy of redeeming

Yo he estado aquí muchas veces antes y regreso

To break down and cease all feeling
Burn now what once was breathing
Reach out and you may take my heart away

Imperfect cry, and scream in ecstasy
So what befalls the flawless?
Look what I've built, it shines so beautifully
Now watch as it destroys me

Y regreso aquí otra vez y comienzo

To break down and cease all feeling
Burn now what once was breathing
Reach out and you may take my heart away

Break down and cease all feeling
Burn now what once was breathing
Reach out and you may take my heart away

I saw its birth, I watched it grow
I felt it change me
I took the life, I ate it slow
Now it consumes me

I break down and cease all feeling
Burn now what once was breathing
Reach out and you may take my heart away

Break down and cease all feeling
Burn now what once was breathing
Reach out and you may take my heart away

Heart away
