(Joan Jett/Paul Westerberg)

I had it made, I never strayed
From a course that somebody else laid
I clenched my fists, I never miss
One nite (one nite) you find that ya can't turn back
So it's goodbye to the past
Here it comes, here it comes feel it comin'
Backlash backlash backlash
Oh yea, it's too bad now it's a backlash

Your time ain't long you don't belong
Maybe so but you hope that they're wrong
Thin skin gets thick it happens quick
Like a baby turn her very first trick
Hold tight (hold tight) hold tight for the ride of your life
And the lovers go by so fast
Here it comes, here it comes feel it comin'
Backlash backlash backlash

Used to love me used to care (do you care?) used to want me
Here it comes, here it comes I guess that's fair

Now, do you love me, do you care, do you want me
One nite (one nite) we find we're outta, outta time
Here it comes, here it comes here it comes a c'mon
