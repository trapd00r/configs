Stand up straight 
Do your trick 
Turn on the stars 
Jupiter shines so bright 
When you're around to tell us slow down, 
We're too young you need to grow 
The speed's the key 
And they don't know who we are 

And who's to say that we're not good enough? 
And who's to say that this is not our love? 

Mother don't tell me friends are the ones that I lose 
'Cause they'd bleed before you 
And sometimes family are the ones you'd choose 
It's too late now 
I hold on to this life I found 

And who's to say we won't burn it out? 
And who's to say we wont sink in doubt? 
Who's to say that we wont fade today? 
Who are they anyway? Anyway they don't know 

And you say we're too young, but maybe you're too old to remember 
And I try to pretend but I just feel it when we're together 
And if you don't believe me, you never really knew us 
You never really knew 

You and I, packin' up my room, we feel alright 
But we're not well comsumed 
We'll be drivin', 'cause they don't know who we are 
Who's to say we won't stay together? 
Who's to say we arn't getting stronger? 
Who's to say I can't live without you? 
Who are they anyway? Anyway they don't know 

And you say we're too young, but maybe you're too old to remember 
And I try to pretend, but I just feel it when we're together 
Who is to say? 
And who is to say? 
And who are they anyway? 

Stand up boy, I shine so bright when you're around
