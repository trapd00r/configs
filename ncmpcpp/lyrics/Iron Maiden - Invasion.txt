[Harris]

The Vikings are coming 
You'd better get ready for we're having a fight 
The longboats are coming 
It's looking like their? in the dead of the night 

Muster the men from all the villages 
You'd better get ready to fight with your enemies 

Beacons are burning 
I'm giving the word to get ready to fight 
The battle is nearing 
You'd better get ready to fight for your lives 

The Norsemen are coming 
The Norsemen are coming 
The warnings are given 
The Norsemen are coming 

Raping and pillaging 
Robbing and looting the land 

Viking raiders from afar
