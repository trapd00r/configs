Oh, yeah
They say in this world, nothing lasts forever
But I don't believe that's true
Cause the way that I feel
When we are together
I know that's the way, I always feel for you 

(CHORUS:)
From now until forever that's how long I'll be true
I will make you this vow and promise you now until forever
I'll never stop loving you

Then will come a day when the world stops turning
And stars will fall from the sky
But this feeling will last
When the suns start burning
But all I wanna do is love you
Until the end of time

(Repeat CHORUS)

It's gonna take more than a lifetime
To give you all the love (all the love)
I feel for you tonight

(Repeat CHORUS (2 times))

Until forever
I'll never stop loving you
