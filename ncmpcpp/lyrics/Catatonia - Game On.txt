You know the time to act is now
Before the sands of time run out
I know that I could never
Fall from grace I'm far too clever

I will achieve my destiny
My star's ascent a certainty
I know that I could never
Fall from grace I'm far too clever

Boy sees, boy takes, boy hooked
And the subject's closed
Worst case scenario becomes real
It don't show

No clever clevers can dissuade
From tougher substance I was made
I know that I could never
Fall from grace I'm far too clever

Boy sees, boy takes, boy hooked
And the subject's closed
Worst case scenario becomes real
It don't show

You know the time to act is now
