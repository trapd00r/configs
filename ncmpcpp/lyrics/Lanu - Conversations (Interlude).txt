Mase f/ Puff Daddy

You ready Mase?
Party people
In the place to be
It's about that time
For us to
Yeah, uh-huh

First Verse:
Yo, what you know about goin out?
Head wet, red Lex
TV's all up in the headrest
Try and live it up
Ride into
Bigger truck
Peace all
Glittered up
Sticker kid
Nigga what? Jig with the cut
Sip Cris, spit it up
Hoes ride, get your nut
Till I can't get it up
I'm a big man, give this man room
I'ma hit everything, from Cancun to man's tomb
Why you standin' on the wall?
Hangin' on your balls
Lighting up drugs
Always fightin' in the club
I'm the reason they made the dress code
They figure I wouldn't wild when I'm in my French clothes
Dress as I suppose, from my neck to my toes
Neck full of gold, but gets in my Rolls
Reck shows, collect those, extra O's
Buy an E, get a key, to the Lex
To hold, East, West, every state
Come on, bury the hate
Millions the only thing
We in the area to make
Better friend or ex-friend
In a Lex or a Benz
Let's begin
Bring this BS to an end
Come on

Chorus:
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
You make me feel so good
You know you make me feel so good
You know you make me feel so good

Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
I wouldn't change you if i could
I wouldn't change you if i could
I wouldn't change you if i could

Verse Two:
You can't understand, we be
Ride kinky, sippin' DP
To the TV, look greedy
Little kids see me, way out in DC
With a Z3, chrome VB's
They want to be me
Nigga's talkin' shit
They ought to quit
I'm fortunate
They don't see a fourth what I get
And those be the same ones walkin' while I whip
Just started seing cars
Cause they alternate
So while you daydream
Mama's city gleam
And I deal with hoes
That pose
In Maybeline
One time you had it all
I ain't mad at ya'll
Now give me the catalog
I'll show you how daddy ball
Six cars in power
The five big stars
Phillip, see, O, Chaz smokin' on cigars
Nigga
It's like ya'll
Be talkin' funny
I don't understand language
In people with short money
Come on

Chorus

Verse Three:
Do Mase got the ladies? Yeah, yeah
Do Puff drive Mercedes? Yeah, yeah
Take hits from the 80's? Yeah, yeah
But do it sound so crazy? Yeah, yeah
Well me personally
It's nuthin' personal
I do what work for me
You do what work for you
And I dress with what I was blessed with
Never been arrested
For nuthin domestic
And I chill
They way you met me
With a jet ski
Attached to a SE
Smoke my Nestle
No mad rap
Ask Cat
Where my check be?
Problem with ya'll
I say it directly
Went from hard to sweeps
Started to eat
From no hoes at shows
To manaj in suites
Now I be the cat
That be hard to meet
Gettin' head from girls
That used to hardly speak
Come on
