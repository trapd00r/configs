The Worm:
Good morning Worm your honour
The crown will plainly show
The prisoner who now stands before you
Was caught red handed showing feelings
Showing feelings of an almost human nature
This will not do

Call the schoolmaster

The Schoolmaster:
I always said he'd come to no good
In the end your honour
If they'd let me have my way I could
Have flayed him into shape
But my hands were tied
The bleeding hearts and artists
Let him get away with murder
Let me hammer him today

Pink:
Crazy toys in the attic I am crazy
Truly gone fishing

They must have taken my marbles away

Chorus:
Crazy toys in the attic he is crazy

The Wife:
You little shit, you're in it now
I hope they throw away the key
You should have talked to me more often
Than you did, but no you had to
Go your own way. Have you broken any
Homes up lately?
"Just five minutes Worm your honour
Him and me alone"

The Mother:
Babe
Come to mother baby let me hold you
In my arms
M'lord I never wanted him to
Get in any trouble
Why'd he ever have to leave me
Worm your honour let me take him home

Pink:
Crazy over the rainbow I am crazy
Bars in the window

There must have been a door there in the wall
When I came in

Chorus:
Crazy over the rainbow he is crazy

The Judge:
The evidence before the court is
Incontravertable, there's no need for
The jury to retire
In all my years of judging
I have never heard before of
Someone more deserving of
The full penalty of law
The way you made them suffer
Your exquisite wife and mother
Fills me with the urge to defecate

Man in audience:
Go on Judge, shit on him!

The Judge:
Since my friend you have revealed your
Deepest fear
I sentence you to be exposed before
Your peers

Tear down the wall.

Chorus:
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down... [Explosion]
