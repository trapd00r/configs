El que no es consejo, no llega el viejo
So listen up

Ooh la la la 
If your girl wanna play, let her go, so let her go (la la la la) 
If your girl wanna play, let her go, so let her go (la la la la)
If your girl wanna play, let her go, so let her go (la la la la)
If your girl wanna play, let her go
