Strange how my heart beats 
To find myself upon your shore. 
Strange how I still feel 
My loss of comfort gone before. 
Cool waves wash over 
And drift away with dreams of youth 
So time is stolen 
I cannot hold you long enough. 
And so this is where I should be now 

Days and nights falling by 
Days and nights falling by me. 
I know of a dream I should be holding 
Days and nights falling by 
Days and nights falling by me. 

Cool waves wash over 
And drift away with reams of youth 
So time is stolen 
I cannot hold you long enough. 
Soft blue horizons 
Reach far into my childhood days 
As you are rising 
To bring me my forgotten ways 

Strange how I falter 
To find I'm standing in deep water 
Strange how my heart beats 
To find I'm standing on your shore
