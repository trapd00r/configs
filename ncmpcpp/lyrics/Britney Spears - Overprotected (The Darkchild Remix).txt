I need time (time) 
(Love) 
Joy (joy) 
I need space 
Love 
I need me 
(4, 3, 2, 1) 

Say hello to the girl that I am 
You're gonna have to see through my perspective 
I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am 
And I don't wanna be so damn protected 
There must be another way 
Cause I believe in taking chances 
But who am I to say 
What a girl is to do 
God, I need some answers 

What am I to do to win my life 
(You will find out don't worry) 
How am I supposed to know what's right? 
(You just got to do it your way) 
I can't help the way I feel 
All my life has been so overprotected 

I tell 'em what I like 
What I want 
What I don't 
But every time I do I stand corrected 
Things that I've been told 
I can't believe what I hear about the world, I realize 
I'm overprotected 

There must be another way 
Cause I believe in taking chances 
But who am I to say 
What a girl is to do 
God I need some answers 

What am I to do to win my life 
(You will find out don't worry) 
How am I supposed to know what's right? 
(You just got to do it your way) 
I can't help the way I feel 
All my life has been so overprotected 

I need' time (love) 
I need' space 
(This is it, this is it) 

I don't need nobody 
Tellin' me just what I wanna 
What I want what, what I'm gonna 
Do about my destiny 
I Say No, No 
Nobody tell me just what what what I wanna do, do 
I'm so fed up with people telling me to be 
Someone else but me 

(Yeah) 

What am I to do win my life 
(You will find out don't worry) 
How am I supposed to know what's right? 
(You just got to do it your way) 
I can't help the way I feel 
All my life has been so overprotected 

I don't need nobody 
Tellin me just what I wanna 
What I what what I'm gonna 
Do about my destiny 
I Say No, No 
Ain't nobody tell me just what I wanna do, do 
I'm so fed up with people telling me to be 
Someone else but me 

What am I to do to win my life 
(You will find out don't worry) 
How am I supposed to know what's right? 
(You just got to do it your way) 
I can't help the way I feel 
All my life has been so overprotected
