[Chorus:]
All my life, had to hustle just to make a way
All my life, riding dirty on the highway
All my life and it all changed in one day
All my life it's the moment I been waiting on

All my life, had to hustle just to make a way
All my life, riding dirty on the highway
All my life and it all changed in one day
All my life it's the moment I been waiting on

The hood never caused but they all was hard
His kind never represented love at all
Purple hearts in the hood, them ghetto scars
Where every time I see my daddy it was just a mirage
Now my mammy need a mechanic when the car wouldn't start
I couldn't understand it, even told it to god
Now my family in jeans, headed straight to the top
Access granted with this empty can of starch
No not the [?] liquor store got robbed
Yellow tape was the moon every night on the block
Surrounded by the stars them dirty cars
Dreadlocks in the grill try to camouflage
Gotta make it out for real for I be at large
I wrote XXL in the view of my squad
Got a record on the shelf they say I'm good at the mall
Gotta learn to help myself no sugar to borrow
Cause...

All my life, had to hustle just to make a way
All my life, riding dirty on the highway
All my life and it all changed in one day
All my life it's the moment I been waiting on

All my life, had to hustle just to make a way
All my life, riding dirty on the highway
All my life and it all changed in one day
All my life it's the moment I been waiting on

A four course meal every first of the month
Everybody in the projects family home
Don't know you till the DJ like I want some
But before thanksgiving, was a catholic nun
Crabs in the bucket dirty 11 to 1
Without the struggle probably never woulda heard of lebron
Try and juggle in the casket with ya sister lavonne
Suicide, live lavish at the tip of my tongue
Only thing come to ratchet was the 23rd song
Yeah it coulda been tragic for the boy from the scums
Yeah he got the craftmatic no rest till I won
Life took a stab at him couldn't punch him alone
Born near the savages kinda made me numb
Two doors from where the dope boi magic was slung
It was real not a fancy, they'd kill ya for crumbs
Only reason why I rap, keep from being a bum
Cause...

All my life, had to hustle just to make a way
All my life, riding dirty on the highway
All my life and it all changed in one day
All my life it's the moment I been waiting on

All my life, had to hustle just to make a way
All my life, riding dirty on the highway
All my life and it all changed in one day
All my life it's the moment I been waiting on

Sitting here, reminiscing,
Of all the nights I had to grind
Taking chances with the system,
I put my whole life on the line
All my life know it ain't been sweet
All my life I been in the streets
All my life up against concrete
All my life mama gave me the speech
All my life somebody died every week
All my life ducking the police
All my life without soda I weeped
All my life no first class seats

All my life, had to hustle just to make a way
All my life, riding dirty on the highway
All my life and it all changed in one day
All my life it's the moment I been waiting on

All my life, had to hustle just to make a way
All my life, riding dirty on the highway
All my life and it all changed in one day
All my life it's the moment I been waiting on
