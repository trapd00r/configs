Verse 1-Kuniva
yo the derelict is back
im blazin niggas while they up in the Sheraton last
i even sold my therapist crack
you niggas is bitch straight up im bearin the facts
i love pussy wit all my heart but i married the gats
and nigga im top pedigree so dont play wit me
ill blow your tattoos all over your baby seat
kids and all be hit
peers and all masuberg will take your back, liver ribs and all
kuniva the street talker, heat sparker the beef starter
packin guns when im sleep walkin
(Bitch keep talkin)
throwin fire bombs down your chimney
while you eatin at wendys
im in your bushes cockin the semi
nice wit the hands
never bow down to another man
i was poppin guns while you was still poppin some rubber bands
smother your clan
sever your hands and your legs
mail your brother your heart and send your mother ya head

Verse 2- Swifty
im the only one your bitch let touch her
type of brother that will fuck your mother
with a fishnet rubber
a belligerent and rowdy mother fucker
that'll dump your body and still fly aw
