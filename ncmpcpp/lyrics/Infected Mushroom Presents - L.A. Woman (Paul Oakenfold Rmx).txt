Well, I just got into town about an hour ago 
Took a look around, see which way the wind blow 
Where the little girls in their Hollywood bungalows 

Are you a lucky little lady in the City of Light 
Or just another lost angel...City of Night 
City of Night, City of Night, City of Night, woo, c'mon 

L.A. Woman, L.A. Woman 
L.A. Woman Sunday afternoon 
L.A. Woman Sunday afternoon 
L.A. Woman Sunday afternoon 
Drive thru your suburbs 
Into your blues, into your blues, yeah 
Into your blue-blue Blues 
Into your blues, ohh, yeah 

I see your hair is burnin' 
Hills are filled with fire 
If they say I never loved you 
You know they are a liar 
Drivin' down your freeways 
Midnite alleys roam 
Cops in cars, the topless bars 
Never saw a woman... 
So alone, so alone 
So alone, so alone 

Motel Money Murder Madness 
Let's change the mood from glad to sadness 

Mr. Mojo Risin', Mr. Mojo Risin' 
Mr. Mojo Risin', Mr. Mojo Risin' 
Got to keep on risin' 
Mr. Mojo Risin', Mr. Mojo Risin' 
Mojo Risin', gotta Mojo Risin' 
Mr. Mojo Risin', gotta keep on risin' 
Risin', risin' 
Gone risin', risin' 
I'm gone risin', risin' 
I gotta risin', risin' 
Well, risin', risin' 
I gotta, wooo, yeah, risin' 
Woah, ohh yeah 

Well, I just got into town about an hour ago 
Took a look around, see which way the wind blow 
Where the little girls in their Hollywood bungalows 

Are you a lucky little lady in the City of Light 
Or just another lost angel...City of Night 
City of Night, City of Night, City of Night, woah, c'mon 

L.A. Woman, L.A. Woman 
L.A. Woman, your my woman 
Little L.A. Woman, Little L.A. Woman 
L.A. L.A. Woman Woman 
L.A. Woman c'mon
