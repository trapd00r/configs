I'm looking at an Angel
And believe me when I say she got that whole place glowing
She got that whole place glowing
She got that whole place glowing (glowing, glowing, glowing)
I'm looking at an Angel
And believe me when I say she got that whole place glowing
She got that whole place glowing
She got that whole place glowing
And she's high in the sky singing
Wooooooooooooh
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Wooooooooooooh
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Wooooooooooooh
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Wooooooooooooh
Way above the clouds in the sky singing

She got wings, she got a halo
It seems to me so unnatural
Cause there's one thing, that I just don't know
What seemed to be so incredible
She looked at me, took me by surprise yeah
As if she took me by the hand to some foreign land, and had me up
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Wooooooooooooh
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Wooooooooooooh

Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Wooooooooooooh
Way above the clouds in the sky singing
Wooooooooooooh
Way above the clouds in the sky singing

Singing my song (yeah yeah), from dusk till dawn (yeah yeah)
I know you got a lot on your mind but it won't be long (yeah yeah)
If all things get better (yeah yeah), and I may be wrong (yeah yeah)
Cause I'll never get to even cross the line before they make it home (yeah yeah)
