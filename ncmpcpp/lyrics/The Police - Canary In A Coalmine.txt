First to fall over when the atmosphere is less than perfect 
Your sensibilities are shaken by the slightest defect 
You live you life like a canary in a coalmine

You're so afraid to catch a dose of influenza

Now if I tell you that you suffer from delusions 
You pay your analyst to reach the same conclusions 
You live your life like a canary in a coalmine 
You get so dizzy even walking in a straight line

First to fall over when the atmosphere is less than perfect 
Your sensibilities are shaken by the slightest defect 
You live your life like a canary in a coalmine
