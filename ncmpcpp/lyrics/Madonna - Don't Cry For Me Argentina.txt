It won't be easy
You think it's strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love
After all that I've done

You won't believe me
All you will see 
Is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you

I had to let it happen
I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window 
Staying out of the sun

So I chose freedom
Running around
Trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

And as for fortune 
And as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desire

They are illusions 
They're not the solutions they promise to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

Don't cry for me, Argentina

Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

Have I said too much 
There is nothing more I could think of to say to you
But all you have to do
Is look at me to know
That every word is true
