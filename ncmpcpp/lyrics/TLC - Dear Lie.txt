Dear lie
You suck
You said you could fix anything
Instead I'm fucked
You made things even worse for me
If I had balls I'd tell you get away from me
Guess I'm not smart
I let you unnerve me
I let you control me
Afraid the truth would hurt me
When it's you that hurts me more

(Chorus:)
Get outta my mouth
Get outta my head
Get outta my mind
Stop puttin' words in my head
Get outta my mouth
You're nothing but trouble
Get outta my life
Get out of me 
Out of me (out of me)
Out of me
Out of me lie
Lie lie lie lie lie

Dear lie
You're dumb
You think you've got the best of me
You think you won
Misread my vulnerability
I've got your balls 
Now get the hell away from me
I've learned your heart
Won't let you unnerve me
Won't let you control me
The truth will only free me
And your lies won't hurt no 
No more

(Chorus)

Lie lie
I've got
Your balls
Now get the hell away from me
I learned your art
Won't let you unnerve me
Wont' let you control me
The truth will only free me
And your lies won't hurt no
No more

(Chorus)

Lie lie
Dear lie
Lie Lie Lie Lie
Lie Lie
Dear lie
