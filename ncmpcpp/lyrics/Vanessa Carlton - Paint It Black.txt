I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colors anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars and they are painted black
With flowers and my love both never to come back
I see people turn their heads, and quickly look away
Like a new born baby it just happens every day 

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door and it's heading into black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black

I wanna see it painted, painted, painted black, oh baby
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted black, oh baby

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

I wanna see it painted, painted, painted black
Oh, black as night black as coal
I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky
Painted, painted, painted black, oh baby
Painted, painted, painted black.......
