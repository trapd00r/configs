I can see 
When you stay low 
Nothing happens 
Does it feel right? 
Late at night 
Things I thought I'd put behind me 
Haunt my mind 

I just know there's no escape now 
Once it sets it's eyes on you 
But I wont run 
Have to stare it in the eyes 

Stand my ground 
I won't give in 
No more denying 
I've gotta face it 
Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside 
If I don't make it, someone else will 
Stand my ground 

It's all around 
Getting stronger, coming closer into my world 
I can feel that it's time for me to face it 
Can I take it? 

Though this might just be the ending 
Of the life I held so dear 
But I won't run 
There's no turning back from here 

Stand my ground 
I won't give in 
No more denying 
I've gotta face it 
Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside 
If I don't make it, someone else will 
Stand my ground 

All I know for sure is that I'm trying 
I will always stand my ground 

Stand my ground 
I won't give in, (I won't give in) 
I won't give up, (I won't give up) 
No more denying (Ahh-hhhh) 
I've gotta face it 
Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside 
If I don't make it, someone else will 

Stand my ground 
I won't give in 
No more denying 
I've gotta face it 
Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside 
If I don't make it, someone else will 
Stand my ground
