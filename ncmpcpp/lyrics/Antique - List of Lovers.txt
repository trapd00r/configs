When I look into your eyes
I can see what's on your mind
'Cause baby, I'm good at understanding
It's alright to make mistakes
To hide what's deep inside
Out babe, I'm never too demanding

You know I will listen
You know I will never judge
Although there are preaches
That maybe right or wrong
Some things cannot be undone

I don't care about my number
On your list of lovers
I'm to love you now
I don't care about the others
On your list of lovers
It's too long to bother me
Anyhow, anyway, anymore

We were captured in between
These valant calm estates
And nothing seems like we planned
But those are fears that are unknown
Will stand pn their own
So don't be afraid, to take my hand

You, are my angel
A soul with your wings of  gold
I'm the one to feel you breathe
I'm the one to  touch your face
And boy, you're mine to embrace

I don't care about my number
On your list of lovers
I'm to love you now
I don't care about the others
On your list of lovers
It's too long to bother me
Anyhow, anyway, anymore

The word is spreading fast that I'm with you
There about the girls that you've been through
You know my  love is  real
Just be  careful it's my precious heart you steal

I don't care about my number
On your list of lovers
I'm to love you now
I don't care about the others
On your list of lovers
It's too long to bother me

I don't care about my number
On your list of lovers
I'm to love you now
I don't care about the others
On your list of lovers
It's too long to bother me
Anyhow, anyway, anymore
