Poppin collars in air
Poppin' shots through ya rearview
Bullets, they tear through
Got niggas wonderin' like.. "What the fuck did I do?"
So niggas wanna go and get they man cause they can't do this shit
Because they ain't got no heart for this.. bust a gun and body shit
Niggas like you probably snitch.. do a nigga then get rich
Niggas like you always fit.. 6 feet deep inside a ditch
There ain't nothin' fuckin' with this.. ya know why?

Ready to hold heat.. drive-by with Rule
Poppin shots through the sun roof screamin' "Fuck You!"
