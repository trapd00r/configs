Well don't you know I need a 
little indulgence? 
Listen to the hunter becoming 
hunted 
Every day there's a million advances 
Don't be too forceful you'll ruin 
your chances 
Well don't you know that time is a 
broken glass 
That splinters against the wall? 
But the picture is coming back 
now baby, 
And I want to take it all 

[chorus:] 

Don't go making all these promises 
you know you cannot keep 
There's a time to play a king and a 
time to be the thief 
'Cause if you're making all these 
promises you know you cannot keep 
You know time will be the thief and 
your fallen king will end up alone 

So let your body move a little 
bit closer 
Silent like the sound proceeding 
a cyclone 
Don't you know that 
powerful thinking 
Can be a force you don't want 
to relinquish? 
Well don't you know that, 
They say that hanging on will justify 
the wait? 
But patience and elated wisdom 
don't share a common phrase 

[chorus]

Well, I'm only hanging on for what 
goes down 
I'm floating high and my feet don't 
touch the ground 
I'd take advantage but I can't see 
through this charade 
So don't you, don't go make it harder 
than hell 
'Cause when it comes down to 
the making 
You better be damned sure you can 
take it 
Hey baby 

[chorus] 

Time will be the thief 
and your fallen king will end up... 
A fool, a fool, a lonely sorry fool 
Oh baby, 'cause I told you baby
