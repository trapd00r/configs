The more I see you
The more I want you
Somehow this feeling
Just grows and grows
With every sigh I become
More mad about you
More lost without you
And so it goes
Can you imagine
How much I love you
The more I see you
As years go by
I know the only one for me
Can only be you
My arms wont free you
And my heart wont try

Each time I look at you
Is like the first time
Each time youre near me
The thrill is new
And there is not a single thing I wouldnt do for
The rare delight of the sight of you
And there is not one single thing
I wouldnt do for
The rare delight of the sight of you
And the more I see you
The more I see you
The more I see you
The more I see you
The more I see you
The more I see you
The more I see you
The more I see you
And the more I see you
The more I see you
The more I see you
The more I see you
The more I see you
Everyday
