In one single moment, your whole life can turn round 
I stand there for a minute, staring straight into the ground 
Looking to the left slightly, then looking back down 
The world feels like it's caved in, proper sorry frown 

Please let me show you where we could only just be for us 
I can change, and I can grow, or we could adjust 
The wicked thing about us is we always have trust 
We can even have an open relationship if you must 

I look at her, she stares almost straight back at me 
But her eyes glaze over, like she's looking straight through me 
Then her eyes must have closed for what seems an eternity 
When they open up she's looking down at her feet 

Dry your eyes mate 
I know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made up 
There's plenty more fish in the sea 
Dry your eyes mate 
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts 
But you've got to walk away now, it's over 

So then I move my hand up from down by my side 
It's shaking; my life is crashing before my eyes 
I turn the palm of my hand up to face the skies 
Touch the bottom of her chin and let out a sigh 

'Cause I can't imagine my life without you and me 
There's things I can't imagine doing 
Things I can't imagine seeing 
It weren't supposed to be easy, surely 
Please, please, I'm begging, please 

She brings her hands up towards where my hands rested 
She wraps her fingers around mine with the softness she's blessed with 
She peels away my fingers, looks at me and then gestures 
By pushing my hand away to my chest, from hers 

Dry your eyes mate 
I know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made up 
There's plenty more fish in the sea 
Dry your eyes mate 
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts 
But you've got to walk away now, it's over 

And I'm just standing there 
I can't say a word 
Because everything is just gone 
I've got nothing 
Absolutely nothing 

Trying to pull her close out of bare desperation 
Put my arms around her, trying to change what she's saying 
Pull my head level with hers so that she might engage in 
Look in to her eyes to make her listen again 

I'm not gonna fucking just fucking leave it all now 
'Cause you said it'd be forever, and that was your vow 
And you're gonna let our things simply crash and fall down 
You're well out of order now, this is well out of town 

She pulls away my arms, tightly clamped round her waist 
Gently pushes me back as she looks at me straight 
Turns around so she's now got her back to my face 
Takes one step forward, looks back, then walks away 

Dry your eyes mate 
I know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made up 
There's plenty more fish in the sea 
Dry your eyes mate 
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts 
But you've got to walk away now, it's over 

I know in the past I've found it hard to say 
Telling you things, but not telling straight 
But the more I pull on your hand and say 
The more you pull away 

Dry your eyes mate 
I know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made up 
There's plenty more fish in the sea 
Dry your eyes mate 
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts 
But you've got to walk away now
