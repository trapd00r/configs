Music & Lyrics by Suzanne Vega 

If your love were taken from me
Every color would be black and white
It would be as flat as the world before Columbus
That's the day that I lose half my sight


If your life were taken from me
All the trees would freeze in this cold ground
It would be as cruel as the world before Columbus
Sail to the edge and I'd be there looking down


Those men who lust for land
And for riches strange and new
Who love those trinkets of desire
Oh they never will have you


And they'll never know the gold
Or the copper in your hair
How could they weigh the worth
Of you so rare


If your love were taken from me
Every light that's bright would soon go dim
It would be as dark as the world before Columbus
Down the waterfall and I'd swim over the brim


Those men who lust for land
And for riches strange and new
Who love those trinkets of desire
Oh they will never have you


And they'll never know the gold
Or the copper in your hair
How could they weigh the worth
Of you so rare
