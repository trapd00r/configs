The moonlight... 
Shines down interstellar beams 
And the groove tonight 
Is something more than you've ever seen 
The stars and planets taking shape 
A stolen kiss has come too late 
 In the moonlight 
Carry on, keep romancing, 
Carry on, carry on dancing 
In the moonlight 
Carry on, keep romancing, 
Carry on, carry on dancing 

You're never safe 'till you see the dawn 
And if the clock strikes past midnight 
The hope is gone 
To move under... 

In the moonlight 
Carry on, keep romancing, 
Carry on, carry on dancing 
In the moonlight 
Carry on, keep romancing, 
Carry on, carry on dancing 

Move. Closer. Passion. Stronger 

There's a magic only two can tell 
In the dark night 
Ultra violet is a wicked spell 
The stars and planets taking shape 
A stolen kiss has come to late 

In the moonlight 
Carry on, keep romancing, 
Carry on, carry on dancing 
In the moonlight 
Carry on, keep romancing, 
Carry on, carry on dancing 

Moving on... Moving all night
