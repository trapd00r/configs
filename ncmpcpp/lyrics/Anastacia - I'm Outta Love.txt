Ooh, oh, whoa
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, aha

Now, baby, come on
Don't claim that love you never let me feel
I should have known
'Cause you've brought nothing real
Come on, be a man about it
You won't die
I ain't got no more tears to cry
And I can't take this no more
You know I gotta let it go
And you know

I'm outta love
Set me free
And let me out this misery!
Just show me the way to get my life again
'Cause you can't handle me
Said I'm outta love
Can't you see
Baby, that you gotta set me free?
I'm outta love

Yeah

Said how many times
Have I tried to turn this love around?
But every time
You just let me down
Come on, be a man about it
You'll survive
True that you can work it out all right
Tell me, yesterday
Did you know?
I'd be the one to let you go?
And you know

I'm outta love
Set me free

And let me out this misery

Show me the way to live my life again

And now I'm moving on
