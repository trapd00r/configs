When I was a little girl
I had a rag doll
The only doll I ever owned
Now I love you just the way
I loved that rag doll
But only now my love has grown

And it gets stronger in every way
And it gets deeper, love it stays
And it gets higher until our day

-Chorus:
And, do I love you my oh my
Yeh, river deep, mountain high (ya, ya, ya)
If I lost you would I cry
Oh I love you baby, baby, baby, baby

When you were a young boy
Did you have a puppy
That always followed you around
Well I'm gonna be as faithful as that puppy
No I'll never let you down

Cause it goes on and on like a river flows
It gets bigger baby heaven knows
It gets sweeter baby as it grows

Chorus

Chorus

I had a rag doll
The only doll I ever owned
Now I love you just the way
I loved that rag doll
But only now my love has grown

And it gets stronger in every way
And it gets deeper, love it stays
And it gets higher until our day

Chorus

I love you baby like a flower loves the spring
I love you baby like a robin loves to sing
I love you baby like a schoolboy loves his bag
I love you baby river deep, mountain high

Ah river deep
Ah river deep
Ah river deep
Ah river deep

Chorus
