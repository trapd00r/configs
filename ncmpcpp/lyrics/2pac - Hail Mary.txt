Makaveli in this, Killuminati, all through your body
The blow's like a twelve gauge shotty (Uhh, feel me!)
And God said he should send his one begotten son
to lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me, eat my flesh, flesh and my flesh

Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la

I ain't a killer but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to getting pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words being quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it

Bow down, pray to God hoping that he's listening
Seeing niggaz coming for me, and my diamonds, when they glistening
Now pay attention, rest in peace father
I'm a ghost in these killing fields

Hail Mary catch me if I go, let's go
Deep inside the solitary mind of a madman who screams
In the dark evil lurks, enemies, see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break, to the flame

Set trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupted, fucked in this shit
Stuck, niggaz is lucky if we bust out this shit, plus
Mama told me never stop until I bust a nut

Fuck the world if they can't adjust
It's just as well Hail Mary

Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la

Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la

Penitentiaries is packed with promise makers, never realize
The precious time the bitch niggaz is wastin', institutionalized
I lived my life a product, made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile, we're too crazy to be humble, we ballin'

Catch me Father please, cause I'm fallin', in the liquor store
That's the Hennessey I hear ya callin', can I get some more
Hail 'til I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there

I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do
One life to live but I got nothing to lose, just me and you
On a one way trip to prison, selling drugs
We all wrapped up in this living, life as thugs

To my homeboys in Clinton Max, doing they bid
Raise hell to this real shit, and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be there in the dark
Thuggin' eternal through my heart, now Hail Mary nigga

Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la

Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la

Kastro
They got a APB, out on my Thug family
Since Outlawz run these streets, like these skanless freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half dead
Head down, K blasted off of Hennessey and Thai
Chronic, mixed it, now I'm twisted, blisted, and high
Visions of me thug livin' getting me by
Forever live, and I multiply survived by Thugs
When I die they won't cry unless they coming with slugs

Young Noble
Peep the whole scene and whatever's going on around me
Brain kinda cloudy, smoked out feeling rowdy
Ready to wet the party up, and whoever in that motherfucker
Nasty new street, slugger my heat seeks suckers
On the regular mashing in a stolen black Ac' Integra
Cocked back, sixty seconds til the draw that's when I'm dead in ya
Feet first, you got a nice gat but my heat's worse
From a Thug to preaching church, I gave you love now you eating dirt
Needing work, and I ain't the nigga to put you on
Cause word is bond when I was broke I had to hustle till dawn
That's when sun came up, it's only one way up
Hold ya head and stay up, to all my niggaz get ya pay and weight up

If it's on then it's on, we rate beat-breaks 
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate
To this shit I don't got, be the shit I gotta take
Dealing with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate
If it's on then it's on, we rate beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate
To this shit I don't got, be the shit I gotta take
Dealing with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate 

Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la
(Repeats in background)

Prince Ital
We've been traveling on this weary road
Long time til I be take off this load
But we ride, ride it like a bullet
Hail Mary, Hail Mary
We won't worry everything will come real
Free like the bird in the tree
We won't worry everything will come real
Yes we free like the bird in the tree
We running from the penitentiary
This is the time for we liberty
Hail Mary, Hail Mary

Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la
