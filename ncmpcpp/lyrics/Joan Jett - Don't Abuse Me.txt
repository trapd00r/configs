(Jett)

Before I was in
A rock n' roll band
I couldn't get the time of day
Now I'm doin' everything I can
I thought I had it made
Strangers drop in
And pretend they're friends
People I don't even know
I want you, I need you
It's so hard to tell
And what you're really feelin' 
Won't show

Don't abuse me
Now you listen to what I say
If you're tryin' to use me
Why don't you just go away

You took me around
An' you showed me the town
I thought you were kind of nice
But if someone stepped in
With more to show
You'd drop me without thinkin' twice
You tie yourself to my apron strings
Thinkin' your friends will be impressed
You get your way by bribin' me
Tellin' me I'm the best

Don't abuse me
Now you listen to what I say
If you're tryin' to use me
Why don't you just go away

Who can I trust an' where can I go
To find someone who truly wants me
Take me for what I am
That's the way it's gotta be
Rock n' roll love you want so bad
Tellin' everybody you're mine
But we both know deep down inside
You're just diggin' for every dime
