Send "Lazy!!" Ringtone to your Cell [Intro]
That's right
Aiyyo Primo...watch this
"Lazy!!!"
See I know there's a lot of rappers right
You give 'em some real akward shit like this
and what they do they come back cryin' like;
"I can't see it I can't feel it"
What it is though, is this "Lazy!!!"
See it's to make 'em lazy crazy "Lazy!!!"
this hot shit right here
Let's make 'em motherfuckin' lazy "Lazy!!!"
So here's how I'ma to flip it for you
Check this out

[Verse 1]
I make short people pay me cause that's way I MAKE MY EARNINGS
Keep it right you keep your life
I don't wanna be in fun in your house WITH MY FOUR POUNDS BURNIN'
Cause I will give you a light
I'ma hardcore nigga from downtown so NIGGAS CAN FEEL ME
Cause I'm hard when I deliver
But I won't stop wocking at heart signs SO NIGGAS CAN'T HEAL ME
I ring god when I deliver
I'm straight from the strongest isle AND I GOT NO -?-
And get wild in any burrow
To my warriors on Riker's Isle I HOPE YOU ALL CAN HEAR ME
Make 'em nice and be this thorough
With a nation of hip hop with everybody down here ROLLIN'
Cause it's Bump takin' the lead
I'm not down with ya hypocrisy FUCK AROUND GET STOLEN
Cause I peal niggaz for greed
Stop grinnin' in a motherfucker face WHEN YOU KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE ME
You get slapped the bitchy way
You can put a bunch of brawl in your voice BUT YOU DON'T SOUND LIKE ME
You get J stay with your way
If you beef without my two-aim PLEASE BE A THUG AND SIGN IT!
Cause it's day for you to hide
I put your body in a river N-Y-P-D WON'T FIND IT
And I pray for you to die
I'm Bump nigga how many times I got to tell you BUMPY
Freddie Foxxx his other half
And I'll thump nigga right from the heart SO YOU NIGGAS CAN -?- ME
I don't waste none the air baby "Lazy!!!"

[Chorus] (2x)
Everybody you know, everybody we know (Come on, that's right)
wanna spit a rhyme on a beat by the Primo "Lazy!!!"
But everybody I know and everybody you know
Know that's one thing not everybody can do though "Lazy!!!"


[Verse 2]
Bump bringin' you another selection FROM MY MAIN MAN PRIMO
To the heart forever plural
For blessin' hip hop with the one nigga PRODUCERS CAN'T SEE THOUGH
To the end should by our girl
If it takes me a lifetime to prove I'm THE NICEST MC
Then I'm down for every war
And if it ever get bigger than rap THEN I GET MY SHIT B
Come on down, I'm holdin' fours
I hate to be pain in the ass CAUSE IT REALLY AIN'T LIKE ME
But I couldn't help but notice
You come into this game with a mask AND SNEAK AROUND LIKE WIFEY
And get popped like shooky sodas
Rap voters get Al Gored, which means low scores
On all the music awards
It's all good though, niggaz from the street DON'T SWEAT NO TROPHY
Cause it don't make you hot
Aiyyo Roy I'm the heavyweight champ of hip hop WALK LIGHTLY
Some of y'all must've forgot
Means nothing to me if another nigga got a Knuckle CAN TRUST ME
And I swear that forever
Cause I ever take a ass-whipping dude YOU WOULD HAVE TO BUST ME
Pretty much I'm sayin'; Whatever
See I punish MC's that come in with big dough
Cause I know they gonna pay they way right too slow
These Hollywood niggaz from the hood better know
I'm so ever soul forever flow
Always quick to they spine I'm never slow
I'm probably something you don't wanna do, let it go
Basketball players, boxers, wrestlers
Don't take it personal cause I'll get the best of ya
Ask these sorry-ass RAPPERS
They know I'm so CRAZY

[Chorus]
