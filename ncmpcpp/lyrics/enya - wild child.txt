Ever close your eyes
Ever stop and listen
Ever feel alive
And you've nothing missing
You don't need a reason
Let the day go on and on

Let the rain fall down
Everywhere around you
Give into it now
Let the day surround you
You don't need a reason
Let the rain go on and on

[Chorus]
What a day, what a day to take to
What a way, what a way to make it through
What a day, what a day to take to a wild child

Only take the time
From the helter skelter
Every day you find
Everything's in kilter
You don't need a reason
Let the day go on and on

Every summer sun
Every winter evening
Every spring to come
Every autumn leaving
You don't need a reason
Let it all go on and on

[Chorus: x2]

What a day, what a day to take to
What a way, what a way to make it through
What a day, what a day to take to

What a way, what a way to make it through

What a way, what a way to make it through
What a day, what a day to take to a wild child
What a day, what a day to take to a wild child
