He threw down the glove you made the mistake
Of picking it up now you're gone
The choosing of guns or fighting with swords
The choice of weapons is done
He'll tear you apart as soon as you start
You know you don't have a chance.

OH...OH...Fight for the Honour
      Fight for the Splendour

      Fight for the Pleasure
OH...OH...Fight for the Honour
      Fight for the Splendour
      Fight for your Life!

Ready to start the duel begins
 the best man wins in the end.
A lunge and a feint, a parry too late
A cut to the chest and you're down
Seeing the stain then feeling the pain
Feeling the sweat on your brow.

OH...OH...Fight for the Honour
      Fight for the Splendour

      Fight for the Pleasure
OH...OH...Fight for the Honour
      Fight for the Splendour
      Fight for your Life!

The fighting resumes, a silence looms the
 Swordsmen move 'gainst each other
A cut and a thrust, a parry, a blow,
 a stab to the heart and you're down
The Angel of Death hears your last breath
Meanwhile the reaper looks on.

OH...OH...Fought for the Honour
      Fought for the Splendour
      Fought for the Pleasure
OH...OH...Fought for the Honour
      Fought for the Splendour
      Fought to the Death
