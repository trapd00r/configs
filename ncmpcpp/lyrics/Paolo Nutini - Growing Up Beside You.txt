Sitting beside you in school
While we'd paint I'd make you laugh
Mine was never very good
Yours looked exactly like the photograph
Looks like I'm growing, I'm growing up beside you

I don't always get the way you feel
But now I've learned to live with that
It's like I'm a part of something real
I was hitting the bottle, now I've broke the seal
Looks like I'm growing, I'm growing up beside you

Chorus:
And the sun sets the scene
While the rain misses me
And all the time I'll be growing, growing up beside you
