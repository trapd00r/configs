Take a look at my girlfriend 
She's the only one I got (ba ba da da) 
Not much of a girlfriend 
I never seem to get a lot (ba ba da da, ba ba da da) 

It's been some time since we last spoke 
This is gonna sound like a bad joke 
But momma I fell in love again 
It's safe to say I have a new girlfriend 

And I know it sounds so old 
But cupid got me in a chokehold 
And I'm afraid I might give in 
Towels on the mat my white flag is wavin' 

I mean she even cooks me pancakes 
And Alka Seltzer when my tummy aches 
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is 
And she loves the music that my band makes 
I know I'm young but if I had to choose her or the sun 
I'd be one nocturnal son of a gun 

(ba ba da da, ba ba da da)

It's been awhile since we talked last and I'm tryin' hard not to talk fast 
But dad I'm finally thinkin' I may have found the one 
Type of girl that will make you way proud of your son 

And I know you heard the last song about the girls that didn't last long 
But I promise this is on a whole new plane 
I can tell by the way she says my name (ba ba da da) 

I love it when she calls my phone 
She even got her very own ringtone 
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is (ba ba da da) 

It's gonna be a long drive home but I know as soon as I arrive home 
And I open the door take off my coat and throw my bag on the floor 
She'll be back into my arms once more for sure

She's got a smile that would make the most senile 
Annoying old man bite his tongue 
I'm not done 
She's got eyes comparable to sunrise 
And it doesn't stop there 
Man I swear 
She's got porcelain skin of course she's a ten 
And now she's even got her own song 
But movin' on 
She's got the cutest laugh I ever heard 
And we can be on the phone for three hours 
Not sayin' one word 
And I would still cherish every moment 
And when I start to build my future she's the main component 
Call it dumb call it luck call it love or whatever you call it but 
Everywhere I go I keep her picture in my wallet like here
