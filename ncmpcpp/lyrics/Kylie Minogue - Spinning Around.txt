(Spinning around, spinning around)
(Oh)

CHORUS:
I'm spinning around
Move outta my way
I know you're feeling me
'Cos you like it like this
I'm breaking it down
I'm not the same
I know you're feeling me
'Cos you like it like this

Traded in some sorrow
For some joy that I borrowed
From back in the day
Threw away my old clothes
Got myself a better wardrobe
I got something to say
I'm through with the past
Ain't no point in looking back
The future will be
And did I forget to mention
That I found a new direction
And it leads back to me, yeah

I'm spinning around
Move outta my way
I know you're feeling me
'Cos you like it like this
I'm breaking it down
I'm not the same
I know you're feeling me
'Cos you like it like this

The mistakes I've made
Have given me the strength
To really believe
That no matter how I take it
There's no way I'm gonna fake it
'Cos it's gotta be real
I've got nothing left to hide
No reason left to fight
'Cos the truth's given me
A new freedom inside
Getting rid of my desire
Do you like what you see

CHORUS

Baby, baby, baby, ooh
(Ooh) You know you like it like this
Oh, baby, baby, baby
You know you like it like this
Oh, baby, baby, baby

CHORUS

Feeling me 'cos you like it like this
Oh, I'm not the same
I know you like it like this, oh, ooh, yeah
Like it like this
Like it like this
(I'm not the same)
Like it like this
I'm not the same (I'm not the same)
Oh
