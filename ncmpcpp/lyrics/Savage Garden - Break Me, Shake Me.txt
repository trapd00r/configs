I never thought I'd change my opinion again 
But you moved me in a way that I've never known 
You moved me in a way that I've never known 

But straight away you just moved into position again 
You abused me in a way that I've never known 
You abused me in a way that I've never known 

So break me shake me hate me take me over 
When the madness stops then you will be alone 
Just break me shake me hate me take me over 
When the madness stops then you will be alone 

So you're the kind who deals with the games in the mind 
Well you confuse me in a way that I've never known 
You confuse me in a way that I've never known 

So break me shake me hate me take me over 
When the madness stops then you will be alone 
Just break me shake me hate me take me over 
When the madness stops then you will be alone 

She says, "I can help you, but what do you say?
But it's not free baby, you'll have to pay."
You just keep me contemplating that your soul is slowly fading

God don't you know that I live with a ton of regret? 
'Cause I used to move you in a way that you've never known 
But then I accused you in a way that you've never known 
But you hurt me in a way that I've never known... 

Break me shake me hate me take me over 
When the madness stops then you will be alone 
Just break me shake me hate me take me over 
When the madness stops then you will be alone 
(Listen, baby)
You'll be, you'll be alone 
Break me shake me hate me take me make me 
Fake me break me shake me hate me take me 
Break me
