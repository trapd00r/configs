Send "Watch Dees" Ringtone to your Cell Artist: DJ Spinna f/ Eminem, Thirstin Howl III


Verse One (Thirstin Howl):
I hit harder
than Forman
landing both both gloves to a low blow
with no cup
leave you Speech-less like when Arrested Development broke up
carry a crow bar for egos that won't budge
crack skulls
through helmets
with the penetration of a screw nailed in
return like I was sending self addressed postage
throw bricks the size of the Stonehenge
before battles, we pour blood
and toast, death to wicked infants
found on the sorceress' doorsteps
slaughter lamb
and boar's head
every MC's cause of boredness
and mind bondage
bronchitis, lung failure
language unfam-i-liar
art through a flooded air brush
??? leave craft
sentences joined with words holding hands
it's a tight squeeze
from where your head will be landing
in exact time flight leaves

&lt;watch this&gt;
&lt;watch this&gt;

&lt;watch this&gt;
&lt;don't watch that, watch this&gt;

Verse Two (Eminem):
Who's arm is this?
I must have cut it off at the pharmacist
and refused to resume my severed prescription of ???
I'm the old man who lives upstairs and starves his pets
and never leaves his house 'cause he thinks his car's possessed
I hate my life
that's why I degrade my wife
grabbed a paper plate to make a sandwich
and just ate the knife
my mother's screaming 'please heal him, take him straight to Christ'
meet you on the street and slap you just to break the ice
made a bomb threat with a fake device
strip you naked twice, pistol whip you and force you to take advice
and if you catch me bobbin' my head to some bullshit spittin'
I was probably just tryin to shake the lice
bugs fallin' out of my head
I'm wishin' I was dead
while I'm crawlin out of my bed
found it red
and my rash is returning
I feel the sensation of burning
occurring, usually during pain for release in my urine
screamin' at my shadow 'please quit followin' me'
these pills keep screamin' 'please quit swollin' me'
the devil keeps screamin' 'please get down on one knee'
took the drugs before the cops ever found them on me

&lt;watch this&gt;
&lt;watch this&gt;

&lt;watch this&gt;
&lt;don't watch that, watch this&gt;
