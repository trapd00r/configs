I know a girl laying down 
She's sleeping 
Weeks at a time 
And when she wakes up 
She watches TV 
Counting cracks in the ceiling 

No, I don't know what she's thinking 
So I give up, waiting for someone waiting 
Talking to someone, staring 

I never come around
I never come around 
I left her fifteen years behind
Girl's laying down 
Never come around 

So much for girl staying 
In afraid of 
Beeing needed 
And seen she watches 
The world on a screen 
She's distant 
And God knows I tried to leave her 
But she's got a constant fever 

I let it slip my mind 
I never come around
I never come around 
I left her fifteen years behind 

I know a girl laying down 
No, I never wasted my time 
We have something in common 
She's as different as I am
