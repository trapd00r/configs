All my people in the crowd
Grab a partner take it down! 

It's me against the music
Uh uh, It's just me
And me, Yeah, C'mon
Hey Britney
Are you ready, Uh uh, are you 

When no one cares
It's whippin my hair, it's pullin my waist
To hell with stares
The sweat is drippin all over my face
And no one's there
I'm the only one dancin up in this place
Tonight I'm here
Feel the beat of the drum, gotta get with that bass

I'm up against the speaker, tryna take on the music
It's like a competition, me against the beat
I wanna get in the zone, I wanna get in the zone
If you really wanna battle, saddle up and get your rhythm
Tryna hit it, chic-a-taa
In a minute I'm a take a you on, I'm a take a you on
Hey, hey, hey

(Chorus)
All my people on the floor
Let me see you dance
Let me see ya
All my people wantin more
Let me see you dance
I wanna see ya
All my people round and round
Let me see you dance
Let me see ya
All my people in the crowd
Let me see you dance
I wanna see ya

So how would you like a friendly competition
Let's take on the song
It's you and me baby, we're the music
Time to party all night long

(Verse 2)
We're almost there
I'm feelin it bad and I can't explain
My soul is bare
My hips are movin at a rapid pace
Baby feel it burn
From the tip of my toes, runnin through my veins
And now's your turn
Let me see what you got, don't hesitate

I'm up against the speaker, tryna take on the music
It's like a competition, me against the beat
I wanna get in the zone, I wanna get in the zone
If you really wanna battle, saddle up and get your rhythm
Tryna hit it, chic-a-taa
In a minute I'm a take a you on, I'm a take a you on
Hey, hey, hey

(Chorus)
All my people on the floor
Let me see you dance
Let me see ya
All my people wantin more
Let me see you dance
I wanna see ya
All my people round and round
Let me see you dance
Let me see ya
All my people in the crowd
Let me see you dance
I wanna see ya

Get on the floor, baby lose control
Just work your body and let it go
If you wanna party, just grab somebody
Hey Britney we can dance all night long

Hey Britney, you say you wanna lose control
Come over here I got somethin to show ya
Sexy lady, I'd rather see you bare your soul
If you think you're so hot, better show me what you got
All my people in the crowd, let me see you dance
C'mon Britney lose control, watch you take it down

Get on the floor, baby lose control
Just work your body and let it go
If you wanna party, just grab somebody
Hey Britney
We can dance all night long

(Chorus)
All my people on the floor
Let me see you dance
Let me see ya
All my people wantin more
Let me see you dance
I wanna see ya
All my people round and round
Let me see you dance
Let me see ya
All my people in the crowd
Let me see you dance
I wanna see ya

All my people in the crowd, let me see you dance
C'mon Britney take it down, make the music dance 
All my people round and round, party all night long
C'mon Britney lose control, watch you take it down
