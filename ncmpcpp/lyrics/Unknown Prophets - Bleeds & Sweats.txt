In my fantasy, I'm a pantomime
I'll just move my hands and everyone sees what I mean
Words are too messy
And it's way past time
To end in my mouth

Paint my face white and tried
Reinvent the sea one wave at a time
Speak without my voice 
And see the world by candlelight

I ain't afraid to let it out
I'm not afraid to take that fall
But I have found beyond all doubt
We say more by saying nothing at all

In my fantasy, no such thing as time
Minutes bleed into days, avant garde
Show me your heresies
And I'll show you mine
We only speak in pantomimes on this carpet ride

I ain't afraid to let it out
I'm not afraid to take that fall
But I have found beyond all doubt'
We say more by saying nothing at all

In my fantasy, you look good entwined
In my hair and skin and spit and sweat and spilled red wine
You're my deep secret, I'm your pantomime
I'll just move my hands I promise you'll see what I mean
