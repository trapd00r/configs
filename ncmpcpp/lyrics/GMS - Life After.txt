Do you believe in life after love
Cher


No matter how hard I try
You keep pushing me inside
And I can't break through
There's no talking to you
It's so sad that you're leaving
It takes time to believe it
But after all is said and done
You're gonna be the lonely one

Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong me enough
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong me enough

What am I supposed to do
Sit around and wait for you
Well I can't do that
And there's no turning back
I need time to move on
I need a love to feel strong
'Cause I've got time to think it through
And maybe I'm too good for you

Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough

Well I know that I'll get through this
'Cause I know that I am strong
I don't need you anymore
I don't need you anymore
I don't need you anymore
No I don't need you anymore

Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough
