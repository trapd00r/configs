I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care, care if it's old
I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind
I don't mind, mind, don't have a mind

Get away, get away, get away
Get away, away, away from your home
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
I'm afraid, afraid, ghosts

Even if you have, even if you need
I don't mean to stare, we don't have to breed
We could plant a house, we could build a tree
I don't even care, we could have all three
She said, she said, she said, she said
She said, she said, she said, she said

I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, care, care if it's old
I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind
I don't mind, mind, don't have a mind

Get away, get away, get away
Get away, away, away from your home
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
I'm afraid, afraid, ghosts

Even if you have, even if you need
I don't mean to stare, we don't have to breed
We could plant a house, we could build a tree
I don't even care, we could have all three
She said, she said, she said, she said
She said, she said, she said, she said

Even if you have, even if you need
I don't mean to stare, we don't have to breed
We could plant a house, we could build a tree
I don't even care, we could have all three
She said, she said, she said, she said
She said, she said, she said, she said
She said, she said, she said, she said
