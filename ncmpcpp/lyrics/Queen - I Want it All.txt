Send "I Want It All" Ringtone to your Cell Adventure seeker on an empty street
Just an alley creeper light on his feet 
A young fighter screaming with no time for doubt
With the pain and anger can't see a way out 
It ain't much I'm asking I heard him say 
Gotta find me a future move out of my way 

I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now 

Listen all you people come gather round 
I gotta get me a game plan gotta shake you to the ground
Just give me what I know is mine 
People do you hear me just give me the sign
It ain't much I'm asking if you want the truth 
Here's to the future for the dreams of youth 

I want it all, (give it all) I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now
I want it all, (yes I want it all) I want it all (hey) 
I want it all, and I want it now

I'm a man with a one track mind, so much to do in one life time
(people do you hear me) Not a man for compromise and where's and why's and living lies
So I'm living it all (yes I'm living it all) 
And I'm giving it all (and I'm giving it all)
Yeah, yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I want it all, all, all, all 

It ain't much I'm asking if you want the truth
Here's to the future, hear the cry of youth (hear the cry hear the cry of youth)
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now 
I want it all (yeah, yeah, yeah) I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now
I want it, Now, I want it, I want it
