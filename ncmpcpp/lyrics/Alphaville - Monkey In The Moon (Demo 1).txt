Send "Monkey in the Moon" Ringtone to your Cell (Lyrics: Gold / Music: Gold-Lloyd-Echolette)
Once I was so sure, once I was so blind
Wonder what you said if you read my mind
Angel in a car, devil on a cross
Scarecrows in the fields, Jesus on the rocks
Letters in the rain, rabbit on the run
God was made for you, lizards for the sun
Monkey in the moon, I can see you through
Monkey in the moon, this one's made for you
(-&gt; message understood?)

Flower in a word, words without a priest
Wings without a bird, beauty without beast
Signal overkill, trains are overdue
Fool upon a hill, ocean overview
Letters in the rain. . .
Fool upon a hill, trains are overdue
Except what we forgot nothing's really new
Head above the clouds, eyes are opened wide
Windmill burning down, walk into the light
Walk into the light
Monkey in the moon...
Letters in the rain
This one's made for you
