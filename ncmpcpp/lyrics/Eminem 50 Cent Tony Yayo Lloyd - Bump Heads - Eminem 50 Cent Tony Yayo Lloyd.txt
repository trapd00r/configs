Yeah, Shady, Hahahaha 
G G G G G G G G-Unit 

[Eminem] 
Here we go again 

[50 Cent] 
Does it make you mad when I switch my flow? 
You can't understand how I get my dough 
50 Cent I'm on fire cause Shady said so 
I'm on fire 

(Eminem) 
Everybody's in a rush try to get the throne 
I just get on the track and try to set the tone 
I ain't tryna use nobody as a steppin stone 
But don't compare me 
I'm better off jus' left alone 
And I ain't even tryna go there wit record sales 
I'm just tryna keep it humble and respect myself 
Say what up, keep steppin, and just rep D-12 
Keep my nose clean, stay away from weapons, jail 
And livin wreckless 
But if you go check my belt 
You may see something else I used to protect myself 
A vest, to stop a Rueger and deflect the shells 
And send 'em back at you faster than they left the barrel 
And I don't even carry guns no more, I don't got to 
Got undercover cops that'll legally pop you 
And I done seen a lot of people cross the line 
But this motherfucker Ja musta lost his mind 
That X, got him thinkin' he was DMX 
Then he switched to 'Pac now he's tryna be him next 
So which one are you? X, Luther, Pac or Michael 
Juss keep singin' the same song, recycled 
We'd all much rather get along and fight you 
Me and Hailie danced to your songs we liked you 
And you don't really wanna step inside no mic booth 
C'mon now, you know the white boy'll bite you 
I hurt your pride dawg and you know I don't like to 
But I will if I have to, with syllable after syllable I just slap you 
Killin' you fasta than you poppin' pill afta little pill of them tabs of that 
shit you on 

But if you want it you got it you'd bump this shit too, if we ain't diss you 
on it 
But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta 
We bump heads wit any motherfucker that wants to 
So whats the, deal where was all the tough talk? 
When I walked up to you like, Ja what up dawg? 
How come you didn't say you had a problem then? 
When you was standin' there wit all your men, we coulda solved this then 
I'ma grown man dawg come holla 
All you did was slapdance, smile and swallow, 
another one of them little X pills in front of me 
And tell me 50 Cent was everything you wanna be come on 

[50 Cent] 
[Chorus] 
I know you don't want it with me 
You know you don't want it with me 
You, talk an' you soon will see 
You don't wanna bump heads with me 
I know you don't want it with me 
You, talk an' you soon you will see 
You know you don't want it with me 

[Tony Yayo] 
You couldn't son me if my father helped you 
My punchlines is hot, my bars'll melt you 
Ja you Stuart Little, shells'll lift you 
Every other week I'm buyin a new pistol 
I clap at your ass with this chrome 38 
And put six thru your hats of seven 3/8 
Irv you ain't Suge Knight, you should shook night 
I put my knife in ya wind pipe and freeze ya on the turnpike 
You know and I know who took ya chain 
You got robbed two times so ya ass is laid 
I'm down to die for this shit all I need is bail 
You betta stick to tha movies with Steven Seigel, bitch 

[50 Cent] 
[Chorus] 
I know you don't want it with me 
You know you don't want it with me 
You, talk an' you soon will see 
You don't wanna bump heads with me 
I know you don't want it with me 
You, talk an' you soon you will see 
You know you don't want it with me 

[Lloyd Banks] 
Fuck that I'm miles away 
And these industry niggas startin' to get outta hand 
I'ma find your whereabouts by stompin' 'em out ya man 
Tellin' New York, even in Compton they understand 
I'm on the block where you was raised doin' chocolate out tha game an'... 
They see me more pop a boy for icey cuz I could 
Shootin' guns for money you probably forgot your way around the hood 
Bitch when you paranoid it's hard to make a song 
Now you want it wit' us, half your artists got to make a point 
Every magazine I own your on your knees takin' prayer picture 
And you ain't even got shot yet, you scared bitches 
You don't know nuttin' about what pain is sucka 
I'll put your ass to the ground like a train conductor, muh'fucker 

[50 Cent] 
[Chorus] 
I know you don't want it with me 
You know you don't want it with me 
You, talk an' you soon will see 
You don't wanna bump heads with me 
I know you don't want it with me 
You, talk an' you soon you will see 
You know you don't want it with me 

[Tony Yayo] 
Yeah nigga yeah 
Shady Aftermath G-Unit 
Fuck you think they call us G Unit for 
Cause we move units uhha 
Don't think we ain't billin you for this motherfucking studio time 
A matter a fact keep call it a 50 we'll call it even
