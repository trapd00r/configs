Yo, Bloodhound Gang and Rob Van Winkle together on this track. 

Stop as we drop this bomb 
Blow up this place like another Vietnam 
Heavy like a Tyson blow to the dome 
Back up son give me room give me room 
To set it off like this don't give it up 
I'm all up in you 'til you just can't get enough 
Real hard to the bone you want more? 
I sneak up on you like a sniper at your back door 
Phat flavor for your brain you know the time 
So check the wrath it's for real 'cause I'm gonna get mine 
Roll up on you like Eastwood 
Blowin' up fifteens as I'm ridin' through your neighborhood 
I spreads butter like Parkay 
Real smooth with the flow and even when I parlay 
Do what you feel and check the skill 
I'm in your grill peep this I got the raw deal 
In your Jeep Cherokee or Land Cruiser 
When you're rollin' through the hood you want use a 
Track like this all up in your eardrum 
So check the E.Q. and let them speakers hum 
And gets crazy like Prozac 
Hype enough to start a party and illy as a heart attack 
Round one round two knock out 
Straight to your head like my round never lights out

Jimmy Jimmy y'all Jimmy damn Jimmy yea 
Gimme the mic Rob so I can take it away 
Got more lines than the welfare office 
Are you upset you'll never get to be as clever as this? 
Spreadin' quicker than your mom have a feel but don't cop it 
Yeah I stole your beat but that's 'cause you dropped it 
Crude as oil unrefined but slick 
I'm gonna get you from behind like a gay convict 
'Cause my name ain't Quasimodo but I still got a hunch 
That like the Jim Jones cult I'll take you out with one punch 
You're Spiro Agnew and I'm the Dick you answer to 
You're sweatin' like a watermelon at a Baptist barbecue 
Sneakin' up like celery yeah I'm stalkin' 
I squeak like Stephen Hawkings yeah but I'm walkin' 
Nose to ground so this Bloodhound will sniff and follow it 
I hope you choke on your pride when I make you swallow it 
Screamin' like a Mimi when you see me comin' near ya 
Like a Kenny Loggins' record no one's ever gonna hear ya 
Like a game of Hide and Seek it's all over if I see ya 
'Cause you're yellower than tinkle and you'll be runnin' like diarrhea
