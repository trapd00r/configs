Walking down some cobbled street
The sound of water near my feet
I found her

A hundred thousand flashes hit my mind
Soon my arms were all around her

We lay and let our heart take wings
and fly across the Seine
Love came for us from the sky
pretending it was rain

Oooh, Paris summer

Standing on some cobbled street
The sound of water near my feet
You found me

I took the wedding ring off of my hand

Before he put his arms around me

I lived my lie and dreamed his dreams
And lay beside the Seine
When I left the tears I cried he though were just the rain

Oooh, Paris summer

Walking down some cobbled street
The sound of water near my feet
I found her

I took the wedding ring off of my hand
Before i put my arms around me

We lay in and let our heart take wings
And fly across the Seine
When she left the tears she cried he thought were just the rain

Oooh, Paris summer
