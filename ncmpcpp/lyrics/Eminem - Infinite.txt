Oh yeah, this is Eminem baby, back up in that motherfucking ass 
One time for your mother fucking mind, we represent the 313 
You know what I'm saying?, cause they don't know shit about this 
For the 9-6 

Verse 1: 
Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction 
To get your brain relaxin, cause they be actin maniac in action 
A brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction 
You looking zany whack with just a fraction of my tracks spun 
My rhyming skills got you climbing hills 
I travel through your mind into your spine like siren drills 
I'm sliming grills of roaches, with sprayed on disinfectants 
Twistin necks of rappers till their spinal column disconnects 
Put this in decks and check the monologue, turn your system up 
Twist them up, and indulge in the marijuana smog 
This is the season for noise pollution contamination 
Examination of more cartoons than animation 
My lamination of narration 
Hit's a snare and bass in the track fucked up rapper interrogation 
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be staring, gazing 
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland... 
I'm Infinite 

Chorus: 
You heard of hell well I was sent from it 
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments 
Now I'm trying to repent from it 
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it... 
I'm Infinite 

Verse 2: 
Bust it, I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense in your elite defense 
I got some meat to mince, a crew to stomp  and then two feet to rinse 
I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil all your fans 
I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal 
One thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people 
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium 
Battle a band of phony MC's and stand the lonely one 
Imitator, Intimidator, Stimulator, Simulator of data, Eliminator 
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus 
Fuck around and catch all of the venereal diseases 
My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces 
My accapella releases plastic masterpieces through telekinesis 
That eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally 
With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite 

Chorus: 
You heard of hell well I was sent from it 
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments 
Now I'm trying to repent from it 
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it... 
I'm Infinite 

Verse 3: 
Man I got evidence I'm never dense and I been clever ever since 
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the M-O 
So I'm assuming all responsibility 
Cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill MC's 
Mic messaler, slamming like a wrestler 
Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler 
No one is speacialer, My skill is intergalactical 
I get cynical act a fool then I send a crew back to school 
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical 
I'd rather let a tactical, tactful, track tickle your fancy 
In fact I can't see, or can't imagine 
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching 
This is for my family, the kid who had a cameo on my last jam 
Plus the man who never had a plan B 
Be all you can be, cause once you make an instant hit 
I'm tensed a bit and tempted when I see the sins my friends commit... 
I'm Infinite 

Chorus: 
You heard of hell well I was sent from it 
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments 
Now I'm trying to repent from it 
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it... 
I'm Infinite 
You heard of hell well I was sent from it 
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments 
Now I'm trying to repent from it 
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it... 
I'm Infinite
