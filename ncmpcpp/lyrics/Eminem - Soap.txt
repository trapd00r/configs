(Roger)
Skylar Montgomery?
(Skylar)
What do you want from me Roger?
(Roger)
I know it was you all along messing around with my dear Veronica.
(Skylar)
Wait a minute.
You hold it right there.
Me and that woman love each other.
(Roger)
Love?
What do you know of love?
(Skylar)
We were destined to be together.
I met her on the beach...
(Roger)
Are you out to destroy me?
(Skylar)
No,Roger.
That's not what I want to do.
(Roger)I love her!
(Skylar)And we're gonna be together, never.
