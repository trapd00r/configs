[Eminem:]
Shady, Aftermath
There she goes shakin’ that ass on the flow
Bumpin’ and grindin’ that pole
The way she's grindin’ that pole
I think I’m losing control.

Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunked, get fucked up
Hit the strip club don’t forget ones get your dick rubbed
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit faceted
Pasted, blasted, puke drink up, get a new drink
Hit the bathroom sink, throw up

Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine
Knowin’ still got a few chunks on them shoestrings
Showin’ I was dehydrated till the beat vibrated
I was revibed as soon as this bitch gyrated
And hips and licked them lips and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing some shit.

[Nate Dogg:]
2 to the 1 from the 1 to the 3
I like good pussy and I like good trees
Smoke so much weed you wouldn’t believe
And I get more ass than a toilet seat

3 to the 1 from the 1 to the 3
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey

I’ve been to the muthafuckin’ mountain top
Heard muthafuckers talk, seen ’em drop
If I ain’t got a weapon I’m a pick up a rock
And when I bust yo’ ass I’m gon’ continue to rock

Get ya ass off the wall with your 2 left feet
It’s real easy just follow the beat
Don’t let that fly girl pass you by
Look real close ’cause strobe lights lie.

We about to have a party (turn the music up)
Let’s get it started (go head shake your butt)
I’m lookin’ for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin’ baby step right up

Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are ’bout it, ’bout it
I’m lookin’ for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say every day she be givin’ it up.

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me.

[Eminem:]
I’m a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about 4 or 5 minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rinse
Swish but don’t spit it, swallow, and I’ll finish

Yeah me and Nate D-O-double G
Lookin’ for a couple bitches with some double D’s
Pop a little champagne and a couple E’s
Slip it in her bubbly, we finna finna have a party.

[Nate Dogg:]
Have a party (turn the music up)
Let’s get it started (go head shake your butt)
I’m lookin’ for a girl I can fuck in my Hummer truck
Apple bottom jeans and a big ol’ butt

Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are ’bout it, ’bout it
I want a bitch that sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can, but she won’t say no
Now look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
Tonight I want a slut. Would you be mine?
Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine.

[Eminem:]
Now imma hope you don’t get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don’t mind
I told him how you like it from behind.

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me.

[Nate Dogg:]
We ’bout to have a party (turn the music up)
Let’s get it started (go head shake your butt)
I’m lookin’ for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin’ baby step right up

Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are ’bout it, ’bout it
I’m lookin’ for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say everyday she be givin’ it up.

[Eminem:]
There she goes, shakin’ that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin’ that pole
The way she's grindin’ that pole
I think I’m losing control.

[Eminem:]
Come on, I ain’t leavin’ without you, bitch, come on with me
And my boy and this boy and this boy and his girl... Nate Dogg.
