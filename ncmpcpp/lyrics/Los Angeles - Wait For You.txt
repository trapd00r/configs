[Recorded January 27, 1962, Los Angeles]

I like a new Lincoln with all of its class,
I like a martini, and third on the glass,
I'm gonna start living, you wait and see,
Nothing but the best is good enough for me.
I like to eat lobster directly from Maine,
I like to see bullfights in sunny old Spain,
I'm gonna start living, you wait and see,
Nothing but the best is good enough for me.
Talley ho, off we go, who can wait another day,
You and me, out on a spree, let's get started right away.
We're gonna go charlin', and have us a fling,
We'll visit a palace, and dine with the king,
We're gonna start living, you wait and see,
Nothing but the best is good enough for me.

[musical interlude]

You and me, on a spree, let's get started right away.
We're a-gonna go charlin', and have us a fling,
We'll visit a palace, and dine with the king,
We're gonna start living, you wait and see,
Nothing but the best is good enough,.
Nothing but the best is good enough for me.
