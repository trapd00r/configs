[Intro: Ice Cube]
Heheheheh!
You know what WestCoast niggas is gon' tell me?
This is too WestCoast!

[Chorus: Jigg sings (Ice Cube)]
Doin' my own, own thang, thang;
And if you got a problem with' that,
Then the Nina go bang, bang! Bang, bang! (yeah, bang!)
And I be everywhere on the map!

[Bridge: Jigg sings (Ice Cube)]
But I rep that West! - I rep that West!
I rep that West! - I rep that West! (uh-huh!)
I rep that West! (c'mon!) - I rep that West!
I rep that West! - I rep that West! (turn it up!)

[Chorus: Jigg sings (Ice Cube)]
Doin' my own, own thang, thang;
And if you got a problem with' that,
Then the Nina go bang, bang! (bang!) Bang, bang! (bang!)
And I be everywhere on the map!

[Bridge: Jigg sings (Ice Cube)]
But I rep that West! (yes!) - I rep that West! (uh-huh!)
I rep that West! - I rep that West!
I rep that West! - I rep that West!
I rep that West! - I rep that West!

[Ice Cube:]
Don't you know that I rep that; why you got to let that
Boy in the buildin' don't you know that
He about to kill 'em! - Don't you know that - he about to hurt y'all feelings
Can't find where am I as well play the villain?
I'm a get him! (get him!) - Why? Cause I can't baby sit him;
I'm a whip him! (whip him!) - Treat him like bad ass children.
Is it evil? - Y'all better call them people
How I get down - just ain't legal!
Money loong! - Sorta like Louis Vuitton
I run this shit right here - call me: "Marathon"!
BOOM! - I blow like a cherry bomb
You a small donation, bitch! - I'm a telethon!
WestCoast million, what is he really on?
Is it that shit - that niggas go silly on?
Hell no, the pyroclastic flow is evident (WESTSIDE!)
And y'all know what I represent!

[Chorus: Jigg sings (Ice Cube)]
Doin' my own, own thang, thang;
And if you got a problem with' that,
Then the Nina go bang, bang! (bang!) Bang, bang! (bang!)
And I be everywhere on the map!

[Bridge: Jigg sings (Ice Cube)]
But I rep that West! (yes!) - I rep that West! (represent!)
I rep that West! - I rep that West! (uh-huh!)
I rep that West! - I rep that West!
I rep that West! - I rep that West!

[Ice Cube:]
West! - I rep that dub! - I rep that S! - "I'm a monster!"
WestSide, Lochness, I'm a problem!
Matter fact I'm a mess, Los Angeles so scandalous
South Central - home of so much potential!
But if you go there the warfare is mental
Bring your wheelchair - you probably gon' need it!
Leave this motherfucker - a paraplegic
Niggas around the world that think they wanna bang,
Don't get your ass caught up like Lil' Wayne!
I'm too WestCoast for the WestCoast
Too Fresno to suritos - Too soul food and burritos!
I'm down with Angelinos!
Go downtown - and give a bum a C-note!
This my town! - I run it! - You walk it!
You just now learnin' the game - I taught it!

[Chorus: Jigg sings (Ice Cube)]
Doin' my own, own thang, thang;
And if you got a problem with' that,
Then the Nina go bang, bang! (bang!) Bang, bang! (bang!)
And I be everywhere on the map!

[Bridge: Jigg sings (Ice Cube)]
But I rep that West! - I rep that West!
I rep that West! (Keep it gangsta!) - I rep that West!
I rep that West! - I rep that West!
I rep that West! - I rep that West! - I rep that...

[Ice Cube:]
And if you got a problem with this
Let me know so I can add your fuckin' name on my list!
All you WestCoast DJ's check your wrists
If you skiddad the big fish to your playlist!
Now - enemies of this industry, I'm a
Hall of famer! - Treated like a stranger!
Fuck that! Another WestCoast banger!
Who gives a fuck if they play it in Virginia? !
I'm a play it on Denker! - Play it Western
All of Van Ness will make your head turn!
Motherfuckers wanna take our style
And run that shit - 3000 miles;
Then - rub your shit all in our face
This - a war show all at our place;
Damn! - Can a nigga get a lil ol' taste
Of some of that shine - it look like mine?

[Chorus: Jigg sings (Ice Cube)]
Doin' my own, own thang, thang; (damn!)
And if you got a problem with' that,
Then the Nina go bang, bang! (bang!) Bang, bang! (bang!)
And I be everywhere on the map!

[Bridge: Jigg sings (Ice Cube)]
But I rep that West! - I rep that West!
I rep that West! - I rep that West! (represent!)
I rep that West! - I rep that West!
I rep that West! - I rep that West! (Keep it gangsta!)

[Chorus: Jigg sings (Ice Cube)]
Doin' my own, own thang, thang; (yeah!)
And if you got a problem with' that,
Then the Nina go bang, bang! (California!) Bang, bang! (Arizona)
And I be everywhere on the map!

[Bridge: Jigg sings (Ice Cube)]
But I rep that West! - I rep that West! (Oklahoma!)
I rep that West! (Colorado!) - I rep that West! (Utah!)
I rep that West! - I rep that West! (Washington!)
I rep that West! (New Mexico!) - I rep that West! (yeah!) - I rep that...

[Outro: Ice Cube]
Y'all know what it is!
Is this too WestCoast for you motherfuckers?
So what? [beat fades out]
Sanctioned by the OG's of America.
The Grand Wizard is a... certified G!
That mean genius, bitch!
