Let me introduce myself 
I'm a social disease 
I've come for your wealth 
Leave you on your knees 
No time for feeling sorry 
I got here on my own 
I won't ask for mercy 
I choose to walk alone 

Oh what's yours is mine, and what's mine is mine too 
If you shake my hand, better count your fingers

What if I do get caught? 
What if there is no judgment? 
If I'm right I lose nothing 
If you're right I lose it all

And I oughta get caught 
Because I'm doing something wicked 
I'm guilty, haunted by my fears 
And the only consequences 
Are dread and the fugitive mind 

You built walls to protect you 
So no one will infect you 
Pursued by those out there 
That vanish in thin air 
Come a long way to find 
What you really left behind 
You don't know when the end is 
But it's coming fast

Oh what's yours is mine, and what's mine is mine too
If you shake my hand, better count your fingers

What if I do get caught?
What if there is no judgment?
If I'm right, I lose nothing
If you're right, I lose it all

I oughta get caught
Because I'm doing something wicked 
I'm guilty, haunted by my fears 
And the only consequences 
Are dread and the fugitive mind
