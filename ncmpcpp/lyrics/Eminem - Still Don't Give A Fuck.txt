A lot of people ask me 
Am I afraid of death? 
Hell yeah I'm afraid of death, 
I don't wanna die yet. 
A lot of people think that I worship the devil, 
that I do all types of retarded shit. 
Look, I can't change the way I think, 
I can't change the way I am, 
but if I offended you, GOOD 
'cause I still don't give a fuck 

I'm zonin' offa one joint 
Stoppin' the limo 
hop in the window 
shoppin' the demo at gun point. 
A lyricist without a clue 
what year is this? 
Fuck a needle, here's a sword 
body pierce with this. 
Livin amuck 
Never givin' a fuck 
Gimme the keys I'm drunk 
and I've never drivin' the truck. 
But I smoke dope in the cab 
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab 
Come back the next week and re-open the scab. 
A killer instinct runs in the blood 
Empty your four clips and bury your guns in the mud. 
I've calmed down now 
I was heavy once into drugs 
I could walk around straight for two months 
with a buzz. 
My brain's gone. 
my soul's worn, my spirit is torn 
The rest of my body is still being operated on 
I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writin' this rhyme 
'cause I'm probably gonna get struck by lightning this time. 

To all the weed that I've smoked, 
Yo this blunt's for you. 
To all the people I've offended, 
Yeah fuck you too. 
To all the friends I use to have, 
I miss my past 
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass. 
For all the drugs that I've done, 
Yo I'm still gonna do. 
To all the people I've offended, 
Ya fuck you too. 
Every time I reminisce, 
Yo I miss my past. 
But I still don't give a fuck, 
Y'all can kiss my ass! 

I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you 
Cut you so fast 
When your blood spilled it was still blue 
I'll hang you 'til you dangle 
And chain you at both ankles 
And pull you apart from both angles 
I wanna crush your skull 
'til your brains leak out of your veins 
And bust open like broken water mains. 
So tell Sadam not to bother with making another bomb 
'Cause I'm crushing the whole world in my palm 
I got your girl in my arm 
and I'm armed with a fire arm 
so big my entire arm's a giant fire bomb 
Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on 
and the pants that match 
here mama try 'em on 
I get amastertive 
with a mouth full of adjectives 
A brain full of adverbs 
And a box full of laxitives 
Proof of all school accidents 
God help me 
before I commit some irresponsible acts again 

To all the weed that I've smoked, 
Yo this blunt's for you. 
To all the people I've offended, 
Yeah fuck you too. 
To all the friends I use to have, 
I miss my past 
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass. 
For all the drugs that I've done, 
Yo I'm still gonna do. 
To all the people I've offended, 
Ya fuck you too. 
Every time I reminisce, 
Yo I miss my past. 
But I still don't give a fuck, 
Y'all can kiss my ass! 

I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it 
I spent a million a track 
And went over my budget 
Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt 
I can't rap anymore I just murdered the alphabet 
Drug sickness got me doin' some bug twitches 
I'm withdrawn from crack so bad my blood itches 
I don't rap to get the women 
Fuck bitches 
Gimme a fat slut that cooks and does dishes 
Never ran with a clique 
I'm a posse 
Kamikaze 
Strappin' the mother fuckin' bomb accross me 
From the second I was born 
my mama lost me 
I'm a cross between Manson, Esham, and Ozzy 
I don't even know why the fuck I'm here in the first place. 
The worst day on this earth was my first birthday. 
Retarded 
What did that nurse say? 
Brain damage 
Fuck I was born during an earthquake 

To all the weed that I've smoked, 
Yo this blunt's for you. 
To all the people I've offended, 
Yeah fuck you too. 
To all the friends I use to have, 
I miss my past 
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass. 
For all the drugs that I've done, 
Yo I'm still gonna do. 
To all the people I've offended, 
Ya fuck you too. 
Every time I reminisce, 
Yo I miss my past. 
But I still don't give a fuck, 
Y'all can kiss my ass!
