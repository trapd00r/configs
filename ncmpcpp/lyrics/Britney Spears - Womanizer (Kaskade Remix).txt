Superstar, where you from? How's it going?
I know you got a clue what you're doing
You can play brand new to all the other chicks out here
But I know what you are, what you are, baby

Look at you gettin' more than just a re-up
Baby, you got all the puppets with their strings up
Fakin' like a good one but I call 'em like I see 'em
I know what you are, what you are, baby

Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby
You, you-you are, you, you-you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer
(Womanizer)

Boy, don't try to front,
I-I know just, just, what you are, are-are
Boy don't try to front,
I-I know just, just, what you are, are-are

(You!) You got me goin'
(You!) You're oh so charmin'
(You!) But I can't do it
(You!) You womanizer

Boy, don't try to front,
I-I know just, just, what you are, are-are
Boy don't try to front,
I-I know just, just, what you are, are-are

(You!) You say I'm crazy
(You!) I got your crazy
(You!) You're nothing but a
(You!) Womanizer

Daddy-O, you got the swagger of a champion
Too bad for you, you just can't find the right companion
I guess when you have one too many, makes it hard, it could be easy
Who you are, that's just who you are, baby

Lollipop, must mistake me you're the sucker
To think that I would be a victim, not another
Say it, play it, how you want it
But no way I'm never gonna fall for you, never you, baby

Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby
You, you-you are, you, you-you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer
(Womanizer)

Boy, don't try to front,
I-I know just, just, what you are, are-are
Boy don't try to front,
I-I know just, just, what you are, are-are

(You!) You got me goin'
(You!) You're oh so charmin'
(You!) But I can't do it
(You!) You womanizer

Boy, don't try to front,
I-I know just, just, what you are, are-are
Boy don't try to front,
I-I know just, just, what you are, are-are

(You!) You say I'm crazy
(You!) I got your crazy
(You!) You're nothing but a
(You!) Womanizer

Maybe if we both lived in a different world, yeah
(Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer, womanizer)
It would be all good and maybe I could be your girl
But I can't, 'cause we don't, you!

Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby
You, you-you are, you, you-you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer
(Womanizer)

Boy, don't try to front,
I-I know just, just, what you are, are-are
Boy don't try to front,

(You!) But I can't do it
(You!) You womanizer

Boy, don't try to front,
I-I know just, just, what you are, are-are
Boy don't try to front,
I-I know just, just, what you are, are-are
