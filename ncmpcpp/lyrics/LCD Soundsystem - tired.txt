Wasted and complacent 
and you about the same 
but still i want to get it 
on with you tonight 
when i was a little boy 
i laid down in the grass 
i'm sure you'd feel the same 
if i could fuck you here tonight 

but i'm never as tired as when i'm waking up 
i'm never as tired as when i'm waking up 
but it feels like i'm in love again 
oh it feels like i'm in love again 
though it feels like i'm in love again 
with what you do 

if we made it happen 
i'm sure what we would do 
run outside and fuck someone 
to show it didn't mean a thing 
seems it could be simple 
if i could just grow up 
never gonna get it now 
cause i'll never grow 

but i'm never as tired as when i'm waking up 
i'm never as tired as when i'm waking up 
but it feels like i'm in love again 
oh it feels like i'm in love again 
though it feels like i'm in love again 
with what you do 

but not with you 
(keep on telling myself it's true) 
but not with you 
(keep on telling myself it's true) 
but not with you 
(keep on telling myself it's true) 
but not with you 
(keep on telling myself it's true) 
but not with you 
(keep on telling myself it's true) 
but not with you 
(just keep on telling myself it's true) 
but not with you 
(just keep on telling myself it's true) 
but not with you 
(just keep on telling myself it's true)
