When there's a shadow, you follow the sun.
When there is love, then you look for the one.
And for the promises, there is the sky.
And for the heavens are those who can fly.

If you really want to, you can hear me say
Only if you want to will you a way.
If you really want to you can seize the day.
Only if you want to will you fly away.

Da da da da, da da da da da.
Da da da da, da da da da da,
Da da da da.

When there's a journey, you follow a star.
When there's an ocean, you sail from afar.
And for the broken heart, there is the sky.
And for tomorrow are those who can fly.

If you really want to, you can hear me say
Only if you want to will you a way.
If you really want to you can seize the day.
Only if you want to will you fly away.

Da da da da, da da da da da.
Da da da da, da da da da da,
Da da da da.

Ooh go doe bay mwa.
Ooh go doe bay mwa.

If you really want to, you can hear me say
Only if you want to will you a way.
If you really want to you can seize the day.
Only if you want to will you fly away.

Ah! Je voudrai voler comme un oiseau d'aile
Ah! Je voudrai voler comme un oiseau d'aile,
D'aile...

Ooh go doe bay mwa.
Ooh go doe bay mwa.

If you really want to, you can hear me say
Only if you want to will you a way.
If you really want to you can seize the day.
Only if you want to will you fly away.

If you really want to you can seize the day.
Only if you want to will you fly away.
