There's something inside me
It's, it's coming out
I feel like killing you
Let loose the anger, held back too long
My blood runs cold 
Through my anatomy, dwells another being
Rooted in my cortex, a servant to its bidding 
Brutality now becomes my appetite
Violence is now a way of life
The sledge my tool to torture
As it pounds down on your forehead 
Eyes bulging from their sockets
With every swing of my mallet
I smash your fucking head in, until brains seep in
through the cracks, blood does leak
distorted beauty, catastrophe
Steaming slop, splattered all over me 
Lifeless body, slouching dead lecherous abcess, where you once had a head
Avoiding the prophecy of my new found lust
You will never live again, soon your life will end
I'll see you die at my feet, eternally I smash your face
facial bones collapse as I crack your skull in half
Crushing, cranial, contents 
Draining the snot, I rip out the eyes
Squeezing them in my hands nerves are incised
Peeling the flesh off the bottom of my weapon
Involuntarily pulpifying facial regions 
Suffer, and then you die 
Torture, pulverized 
At one with my sixth sense, I feel free
To kill as I please, no one can stop me 
Created to kill, the carnage continues
Violently reshaping human facial tissue 
Brutality becomes my appetite
Violence is now a way of life
The sledge my tool to torture
As it pounds down on your forehead
