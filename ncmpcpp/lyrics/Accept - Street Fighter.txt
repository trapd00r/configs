Black leather - steel engines
All the people call us street fighting man
Rude manners - hard women
That's the reason why we join the gang

No friendship - damned cops
We just stay the way we are
Drugs and whisky - downtown heroes
We control the city roads

Free wheelin' on the highway
A hundred engines are racing around
Like thunder and lightning
Can't you hear the roaring sound

Making rules - giving orders
You're thinking that you are the stars
But we hate your damned faces
Your little houses and bloody cars

Hate you hate you, leave us alone man
Keep your stuff and stay where you are
Hate you hate you, leave us alone man
Keep your stuff, and stay where you are

Hate you hate you, leave us alone man
Keep your stuff and stay where you are
Hate you hate you, leave us alone man
Keep your stuff, and stay where you are

Black leather - steel engines
All the people call us street fighting man
Rude manners - hard women
That's the reason why we join the gang

No friendship - damned cops
We just stay the way we are
Drugs and whisky - downtown heroes
We control the city roads

Hate you hate you, leave us alone man
Keep your stuff and stay where you are
Hate you hate you, leave us alone man
Keep your stuff, and stay where you are

Hate you hate you, leave us alone man
Keep your stuff and stay where you are
Hate you hate you, leave us alone man
Keep your stuff, and stay where you are
Stay where you are
