Get me through the heart of the freeway 
Got to see the lights up in New York city 
I'm so close I think I can hear the sound of the taxi siren symphony 
Don't you want to feel amazing? 
Baby You know I do 
You get back ten times what you give freely 
Like my mamma told me 
Love can move you take you deeper every time 
Can make the darkest moments feel like heaven's come alive 
Love can move you to a place inside your heart 
Where you can fear no evil, acceptance is a natural part of life 

Get me to the heart of the subway 
Creepin' like a snake into New York city 
I'm so close I think I can see those lights 
Let the sun get closer to the ground 
Don't you want to feel amazing? 
Baby you know I do 
You get back ten times what you give freely 
Like my mamma told me 

Love can move you take you deeper every time 
Can make the darkest moments feel like heaven's come alive 
Love can move you to a place inside your heart 
Where you can fear no evil, acceptance is a natural part of life 

It's about the one thing 
Not about the kind of shoes your wearing 
Not about religion

And I breathe the love you've given 
And I feel the love you've hidden 
And though it's cold down here well I can honestly say 
I can still stay 

That love can move you 
That love can move you too child 

Love can move you take you deeper every time 
Can make the darkest moments feel like heaven's come alive 
Love can move you to a place inside your heart 
Where you can fear no evil, acceptance is a natural part of life
