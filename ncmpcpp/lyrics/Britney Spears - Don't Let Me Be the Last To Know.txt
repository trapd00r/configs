My friends say you're so into me
And that you need me desperately
They say you say we're so complete

But I need to hear it straight from you 
If you want me to believe it's true
I've been waiting for so long it hurts
I wanna hear you say the words, please

CHORUS
Don't, don't let me be the last to know
Don't hold back, just let it go
I need to hear you say
You need me all the way
Oh, if you love me so,
Don't let me be the last to know

Your body language says so much
Yeah, I feel it in the way you touch
'Till you say the words
It's not enough
C'mon and tell me you're in love please

CHORUS-
Don't, don't let me be the last to know,
Don't hold back, just let it go
I need to hear you say
You need me all the way
Oh, if you love me so
Don't let me be the... last to know (yeah)

C'mon baby, c'mon darling,
C'mon, let me be the one
C'mon now, oh, oh, oh 

I need to hear you say (I need to hear you say)
You love me all the way (You love me all the way)
And I don't wanna wait another day (And I don't wanna wait another day)
I wanna feel the way you feel
Oh, c'mon

CHORUS
Don't,(don't), don't let me be the last (just let me be the one)
Don't (don't) hold back (hold back), just let it go (just let it go)
I need to hear you say (I need to hear you say)
You need me all the way (You need me all the way)
So...baby, if you love me
Don't let me be the last to know
