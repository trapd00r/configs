[Chorus]
Ridin, survivin
Tryin not to die and tryna cop a island
5'9" and, sleazy
The game needs me, cause I'm drama
I got problems, I can't resolve 'em
It's no beefin, I can't call 'em
I'm ridin, survivin
Tryin not to die then, look him in his eyes then

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Royce 5'9", YEAH.. yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, remember me?

The hype man that came in to blaze shit
Brought in by the white man like I came on a slave ship
and chains; no master can turn his back on the only rapper
can match him and burn him on his own track with him
No goin back with him; cause holmes actin like
he got Capone backin him (why?) He's gone platinum
WOW, I'm hurt, cause now his words
Cause now he famous 'bout as down to earth as it rains the worst
My value will grow with my next release
CUT THE CHECK, I suggest you invest in extra ink
My next album should raise the brow of every man, woman and child
And today, I gotta get paid
You got a sign on your door that says "Keep Out"
I can't fire no more, I can't reach out
You truly know more later after you learn
My last favor to ask you was when, "Don't do me no more favors"

[Chorus]

[Royce â over Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
5'9", yeah
Cause I'm drama, yeah!
How the fuck you gon' forget about me niggaz?

[Outro: Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah, yeah, I'ma show you muh'fuckers
how to go from no buzz, to a big-ass buzz
I'm a ill motherfucker
I don't need nobody to hold my motherfuckin hand
Whatever niggaz, one hun'ned
'03 is my year nigga, Royce 5'9"
The drama king nigga, DRAMA

[Chorus]

[Royce â over Chorus]
