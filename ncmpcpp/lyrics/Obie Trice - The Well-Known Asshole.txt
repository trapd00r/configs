[Intro - Obie Trice - talking (echo)]
Yeah, yeah, welcome, yeah
Obie Trice, the (Well Known Asshole)
Has just entered, motherfuckin demented
Check me out, y'all ain't ready
Yo, yo

[Verse - Obie Trice]
I walk the blocks in anger, your family's in danger
Young, black male, livin in Hell
Screamin "FUCK THAT SHIT!" (FUCK THAT SHIT!), speech description
Worries the old people, plus it keeps my mama bitchin
Low life, inflicted, liquor drinkin adolescent
Just was struck with the fact world ain't pleasant
Middle class nigga but daddy ain't home
Runnin the block with thugs Face and Jerome
Cocked my first heater, darin a nigga to step up
Gettin shot in the fuckin gut
That's 'cause I'm raunchy, channel my anger to stay grimy
Through this rap shit to prevent legal action (legal action)
No more jail cells for me (jail cells for me)
So to ceast the agony I just fuck up emcees (fuck up emcees)
Lacerate body parts
Fuck up your stage art, rippin microphones apart
Remain focused (remain focused), never no time for hocus pocus
Death to the emcee who front like he the dopest
Take a rope and wrap it around your neck (around your neck)
And squeeze, 'til I hear that shit crack (shit crack)
Who's next in line to get hit with a rhyme
That's built accordingly to destroy mankind (destroy mankind)
Obie Trice on the grind (grind), aiyyo (aiyyo ...)
