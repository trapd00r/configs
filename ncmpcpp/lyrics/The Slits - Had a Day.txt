Send "Spend, Spend, Spend" Ringtone to your Cell am trapped in a flood, but it isn't raining 
I have a tendency to get bored too quickly 
Recently my dull life seems to have no meaning 
I am stuck with someone we're not communicating 

I want to buy 
(Have you been affected?) 
I need consoling 
(You could be addicted) 
I need something new 
Something trivial would do 
I want to satisfy this empty feeling 

Walking down the street looking in the windows 
The TV, the lights flickering in other peoples windows 
Imagine myself moving in the kitchens 
Somehow I don't know, it just looks so tempting 

I want to buy 
(Have you been affected?) 
I need consoling 
(You could be addicted) 
I need something new 
Something trivial would do 
I want to satisfy this empty feeling 

I've got a new, improved remedy 
Two of my lonely fantasies ????? 

When I supply myself with something new... 

Going home, into bed when I've treated myself 
I've been quite hard, after a hard day's work 
I have found a hundred ways to get rid of all my worries 
He's not pillaging, stopping me, committing the crime ?? 

I want to buy 
(Have you been affected?) 
I need consoling 
(You could be addicted) 
I need something new 
Something trivial would do 
I want to satisfy this empty feeling 

I've got a new improved remedy 
Two of my lonely fantasies
