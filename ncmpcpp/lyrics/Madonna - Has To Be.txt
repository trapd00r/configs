Breathe in, breathe out
I say a little prayer
How the gods above
Could be so unfair

Chorus:

I know there's someone out there
Waiting for me
There must be someone out there
There just has to be

Go on, go on
Don't sit there like a fool
You've graduated from
A different kind of school

(chorus, repeat)

I should be glad that I'm alive
It could have been much worse
I might have never loved at all
And never known what I am worth

How the gods above
Could be so unfair

(chorus, repeat)
