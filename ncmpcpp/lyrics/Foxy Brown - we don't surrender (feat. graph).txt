[R. Kelly]
No matter what ya'll say or do
We gotta get this money
Watch out playa, we come for you
Take all of your honies
First of the month and rent is due
We gotta get this paper
Come for us, we'll wait for you
A million men can't take us

[1] - Did you ever think that you would be this rich
Did you ever think that you would have these hits
Did you ever think that you would be the don
Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn

Did you ever think that you would be this paid
Were there times when your ass was real afraid
Did you ever think that you would sell out tours
Have a show with fifty million viewers

I used to think about how I was gonna make it
Struggling day to day just trying to get this paper
Hoping the day would come when things would go my way
But now I'm living lavish and all I do is hear them say

[Repeat 1]

[Nas]
Hey yo
Now who knows poverty like Robert and me
Q, did you ever think you'd be dancin' and vibin' with me
Q, did you ever think you'd push a Ferrari, blast a Nas CD
With 5 TV's and DVD's, come on ride with me
Hey then you fly like me
Honey you heard about the style I got
We from the wildest plot, we're police
May the rest carry heat where best, we ghetto
Never thought we'd ever reach this level
My people behind metal
The streets coulda had us, but now we live lavish
Our preach be the baddest
Bus 'em out while maids change the sheets on the mattress
It's deep cuz I never thought I'd reach this status
Walk around and grown women stop and look
They recognize me, no longer hide they pocketbooks
Hate me now cuz I ain't gonna stop, you're stuck
The remix is R. Kelly, please drop the hook
Come on

[Repeat 1]

[R. Kelly]
America
Did you ever think
Ya ever know
Did ya ever think
Ya ever know
(Come on)

Did ya ever think
Ya ever know
Did ya ever think
Ya ever know
(Trackmasters)

[Repeat 1]

No matter what ya'll say or do

Watch out playa, we come for you
Take all of your honies
First of the month and rent is due
We gotta get this paper
Come for us, we'll wait for you
A million men can't take us

I just wanna thank God
