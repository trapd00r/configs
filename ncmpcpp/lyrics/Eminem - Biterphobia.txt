[DJ scratching] - "Do it!"

[Eminem]

Sneakin in through the back door, fruity MC's get ambushed 
Rammed and squooshed, slammed and pushed, crammed and mushed 
Then I'm movin on down from the right to left 
So bite the meth or prepare to fight to death 
To get jacked, attacked and cracked in two 
Smackin through 'til youre black and blue for actin true 
I'm dreaded like a man whose hair is all strands 
Proof that I be sniffin on aerosol cans 
I'm stompin, I'm kickin, I'm chokin, I'm stampin em 
clompin em, stickin, and pokin and clampin em 
To electric chairs and tightenin bolts 
Hit em with frightening jolts of lightning bolts 
I'm zappin, rappers, singers, and dancers 
Faster than you could snap your fingers for ransom 
Cancer is in the flesh, alive and breathin 
Survivin by connivin and theivin 

[DJ scratching] - "Do it!", "Eat em up" 


[Eminem] 

I had a dream I was gettin jacked by biters 
It felt like I was bein attacked by spiders 
Developin a fear of biterphobia 
I'm holdin a gas can and lighter over ya 
If I detect ya, I'ma pulverize 
Dissect your brain, diggin in your skull for lies 
And I'ma torture, with material iller 
than a stark ravin mad serial killer 
I'm more dangerous than a loaded chamber is 
A major risk to a plagiarist 
So beware of the aura, A terror for the horrible 
Will scare ya tomorrow, is the airbourne assault of the rappers 
Hit the source to better my skills, 
I head for the border 
And run the Galloping Hills, the choice is yours 
Cause now buddy's noises force me to scream til my voice is hoarse 
Cause I'm sick of these jabber jaws and crap that grab at yours and savage yours to bite like Labradors 
In the range of my double-barrel 
And your life is in danger, trouble, and peril

[Eminem] 

I trample and stamp liars, like they were campfires 
Cuz vampires bite on my balls and clamp pliers 
And swing on my big thingamajig 
So I'm bringin my nig Proof for backup when I sing at my gig 
Cause biters are fallin head over heels 
In love with every rhyme that I've said over reels 
That's how I became paranoid 
Chewin my fingernails, pullin my hair annoyed 
Cause every time you bit it was deliberate 
So I'm forced to hit a little quicker with 
an ultimatum I assault and slayed em 
with rhymes and it's ultimatum just to cultivate em 
Energetic and imaginative, 
pronouns and verbs, predicates and adjectives 
Will reach out and grab ya, 9 times outta 10 
That's why I'm spilling one of a kind rhymes out a pen
