Yes I needed some time to get away
I needed some peace of mind
Some peace of mind that'll stay 
So I thumbed it. Now it's six in L.A.
Maybe a greyhound could be my way 

Police and niggers, that's right 
Get outta my way
Don't need to buy none of your 
Gold chains today
Now don't need no bracelets 
Clamped in front of my back
Just need my ticket 'till then
Won't you cut me some slack

You're one in a million
Yeah that's what you are
You're one in a million babe
You're a shooting star
Maybe some day we'll see you
Before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you
But you were much to high.
Much too high... 
Much too high...
Much too high...

Immigrants and fagots
They make no sense to me
They come to our country 
And think they'll do as they please
Like start some mini-Iran
Or spread some fucking disease
And they talk so many God damn ways
It's all Greek to me

Well some say I'm lazy
And others say that's just me
Some say I'm crazy
I guess I'll always be
But it's been such a long time
Since I knew right from wrong
It's all the means to and end I'm 
I keep it moving along
Hey, hey, hey, yeah

You're one in a million
You're a shooting star
You're one in a million babe
You know that you are
Maybe some day we'll see you
Before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you
But you were much to high
Much too high 
Much too high

Radicals and racists
Don't point your finger at me
I'm a small town white boy
Dust tryin' to make ends meet
Don't need your religion 
Don't watch that much TV
Just makin' my livin' baby 
Well that's enough for me

You're one in a million
Yeah that's what you are
You're one in a million babe
You're a shooting star
Maybe some day we'll see you
Before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you
But you were much too high
Much too high 
Much too high
