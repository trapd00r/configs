(Verse 1) 
It's the N-E-Double L-Y 
I said it so I keep it realz up in my hood,on the dirty like Bledsoe 
Ain't got no twist in my hair,but I'm still dread throwin 
I gots plenty of bread so I go to bed full now 
Ain't in it to win,to win it I'm all in 
I might call you my cuz youngblood,but we ain't kin naw 
Ya think of jumpin man,you best think again 
Lil dirty,I'm the type of man that might could go for revenge 
Have some not so nice friends,kick the door off the hinge 
Take the door of ya Benz,p-p-pop 4 of your friends 
This here ain't cynical (Uh uh) 
Mental,subliminal,I'm physical,financial,and mental to be a general 
Lil mama come,she want a soldier 
Not the type be in the tank,but in that Rover 
I'm in the zone like AIDS full blown 
I'm killin it like a blind man readin,I'm feelin it like (BOOM!)
