Where would you be without music
You would be nowhere at all
We wouldn't be here doing this now
If you weren't having a ball

One for the road, sharing our load, show us the way

Can you imagine the silence
Not even the pink or white noise
Well thankfully we've got the license
To have us some fun with the boys

One for the road, sharing our load, show us the way

The melody line's fascinating
The rhythm is something divine
It sends our adrenaline racing
To see you all moving so fine

One for the road, sharing our load, show us the way
One for the road...
