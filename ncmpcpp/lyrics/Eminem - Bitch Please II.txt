(Snoop)(Dr. Dre) 
(Yeah, what up Detroit?) 
Nah-uh, nah-uh uh-uh oh no he didn't 
They didn't do it again 
Wha-what? What? 
you shit on these niggas 2 times dr. dre?(Oh fo'sho) 
Uh-uh no 
You smell that 
This is special right here 
It's a toast to the boogie baby 
To tha boogie oogie-oogie 
Yeah ya know 
What's cracking Dre? 

(tha Dr. Dre)
Just let me lay back and kick some mo' simplistic pimp shit
On Slim's shit, start riots like Limp Bizkit
(Limp Bizkit!)
Throw on Guilty Conscience at concerts
And watch mosh pits till motherfuckers knock each other unconscious
(That's right nigga)
Some of these crowds that Slim draws
Is rowdy as Crenshaw Boulevard when it's packed and full of cars
Some of these crowds me and Snoop draw
Is niggas from Crenshaw, from Long Beach to South Central
(Whoa!)
*Girl screams
Not these niggas again, these grown ass ignorant men
With hand triggers again (Shit)
You and what army, could harm me
D-R-E and Shady with Doggy from Long Beach
(Snoop, Eastside)
We came a long way to making these songs play
It a be a wrong move to stare at me tha wrong way
I got a long uz- and I carry it all day
Sometimes it's like a nightmare, just being An-dre
But I...

(Snoop Dogg)
Somehow someway
Hello nigga!
You know about Doggy, Snoop Dogg
Now let me cut these niggas up
And show 'em where tha fuck I'm comin' from
I get tha party crackin' with the shit that I be spittin son
Hit and run, get it done, get the funds, split and run
Got about 50 guns, and I love all of 'em the same
Bang! Bang!
Damn baby girl what's yo name?
I forgot, what'd you say it was?
Damn a nigga buzzed
(Fucked up)
Hangin' in tha club wit my nephew Eminem
(What's up Slim?)
What up cuz?
(What's up Snoop?)
The great white American hope
Done hooked up with the king of the muthafuckin' West Coast baby

(Nate Dogg)
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat *gunshot
(Snoop)
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

(Xzibit)
I'm the head nigga in charge
I'm watching you move
You're found dead in your garage
With 10 o'clock news coverage
Gotta love it cause I expose tha fasciad
Your little lungs is too small to hot box with God
All jokes aside come bounce wit us
Standing over you with a 12 gauge about to bust
It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in a body bag but never in cuffs
So who do you trust, they just not rugged enough
When things get rough I'm in tha club shooting with Puff
*Gunshots
Bitch please, you must have a mental disease
Assume tha position and get back down on your knees come on
*Gunshots

(Nate Dogg)
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat *gunshot
(Snoop)
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

(Nate Dogg)
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat *gunshot
(Snoop)
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

(Eminem)(Snoop)
Ah no, Big Slim Dogg, 80 pound balls
(What?)
Dick six inch long
(Huh?)
Back up in tha heezy baby
He's Shady!
(He's so crazy!)
Give me tha mic, let me recite 'til Timothy White
Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if he's right?
I'm just a criminal making a livin' off the world's misery
What in the world gives me the right?
To say what I like and walk around flippin' the bird
Livin' tha urban life like a white kid from the 'burbs
Dreamin at night and screamin' at moms schemin' to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me and people to see
That somewhere deep down is a decent human being in me
It just can't be found so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is cause this is me now, the recent dude is being this mean
So when you see me dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard tha CD using tha fag word so freely
It's just me being me, here want me to tone it down
Suck my fuckin' dick you faggot!
You happy now? Look here!
I start some trouble everywhere that I go
Ask tha bouncers in the club cause they know
I start some shit they throw me out the back do'
Come back and shoot the club up wit a fo-four

(Nate Dogg)
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat *gunshot
(Snoop)
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

(Nate Dogg)
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat *gunshot
(Snoop)
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

(Xzibit)
