I don't think about it anymore so why do you
I don't remember much but I'm sure that we were through
I'm looking for your eyes to search for what they might disguise so why do you
I've got no problem so why do you
You're blowing on the ashes that's what I think you do
It's been a secret that never got that deep inside so it hurt the spot at any time
That deep inside, to hurt the spot, at any time
After all this time why would I turn around for you
The truth has faded into a lie
Among all things that I could do I obviously still bother you why do I
I'm just wishing you could forgive
It is what we do, to make life easier to live
