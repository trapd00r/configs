I'm a priest for the poorest sacrifice
I'm but a raft in a sea of sorrow, sorrow and greed
You bathed in my wine
Drank from my cup, mocked my rhyme
Your slit tongues licked my aching wounds

(Put a stake) Through my heart
And drag me into sunlight
(So awake) For your greed
As you're slaying the dreamer

Swansong, for the Wish of Night
God it hurts, give a name to the pain
Our primrose path to hell is growing weed

(Put a stake) Through my heart
And drag me into sunlight
(So awake) For your greed
As you're slaying the dreamer

Blame me, it's me
Coward, a good-for-nothing scapegoat
Dumb kid, living a dream
Romantic only on paper

Tell me why - you took all that was mine
Stay as you lay - don't lead me astray
Tell me why - you took all that was mine
Stay as you lay - don't lead me astray

Wake up, mow the weed
You'd be nothing without me
Take my life if you have the heart to die

You bastards tainted my tool
Raped my words, played me a fool
Gather your precious glitter and leave me be
The Great Ones are all dead
And I'm tired, too

I truly hate you all
