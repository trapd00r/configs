I know you're leavin' babe, 
Goodbye, so long. 
I hope someday somebody 
Listens to your song. 
Those bright lights never ever 
Spell your name it's true. 
Maybe a change of scene 
Will be the best for you. 

So long babe, so long babe, 
So long babe, so long babe 
So long babe 

I know you're leavin' babe, 
Goodbye, so long. 
Pick up the pieces 
And go back where you belong. 
You gave them all you had 
And what did they give you? 
Well they gave you nothin' babe 
So give 'em nothin' too. 

So long babe, so long babe, so long babe 
So long babe, so long babe, so long babe, 
So long babe. 

I know you're leavin' babe, 
Goodbye and so long. 
You never made it babe, 
I wonder what went wrong. 
They never understood your songs, 
Here's what you do 
Just walk away and leave 'em, 
And let 'em come to you. 

So long babe, so long babe, 
Yeah so long babe, so long babe 
So long babe, so long babe, 
So long babe 
So long babe, 
Ah so long babe 
So long babe 
Mmm So long babe
