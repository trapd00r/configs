I got blood on my hands and there's no remorse 
I got blood on my dick cuz I fucked a corpse 
I'm a nasty nigga when u pass me nigga look me in my eyes 
And tell me to my fuckin face that u ready to die 
U be a dead mutha fucka red mutha fucka 
Don't be stupid you heard what I said mutha fucka 
Who shot u ohhh nigga like u don't know 
Stickin you for your doe while I'm fuckin your broke ho 
Yo don't u get the picture niggaz can't touch me 
Cuz I don't give a fuck G I'll get u touched B 
I got choice ripple my slug'll take apart a door 
And enuf crazy niggaz behind me to start a war 
So what u want nigga help me is about your best 
When I'm finished Red Cross couldn't clean up the mess 
And a vest will do nothin but make u look a little thicker 
Cuz in the dark u ain't nothin but a lil nigga 
But if you've been thinkin about that shit u did 
You wouldn't have brought the joint wit u kid 
Now I might have to get u kid and split your wig wit a machedi 
I bring beef to niggaz and string them out like spaghetti 
U ain't ready lord can u stand how I'm bringin it 
I'm givin it is how I'm livin it so I'm swingin it 
Red dot on your head cuz you's in mid range 
Red dot on your chest opens up your rib cage
I'm a cruddy nigga, goin' up raw-dog in dirty bitches
and if I get burnt, I'm givin that shit to thirty bitches
You say you know a nigga like me, guess again Poppy
I might smile up in your face but I ain't your friend Poppy
Jump out the fifteen hundred like runnin, niggas don't want it
Get it, Done it, when I'm blunted
However it went down, I made it happen, I made it scrapin'
I made it fussin, bustin, I made it cappin
And lettin off wasn't nothing new to a nigga
Something to do to a nigga, Cause you is a fool nigga
I know your type, you hype, all up off that fake shit 
You can't understand why a man would have to take shit
Or steal shit, but this is that real, niggas kill shit, peel shit
I hit you in your head you won't feel shit!!! Uhhh!
Let the dogs lose on a niggas ass
Find out if the niggas faster then the trigger's blast
A fucking snake in the truest form 
Knowin' damn well that what I do is wrong, but still I do it strong
Niggas is making movies so i gots to stop production
I need a block to function and maybe I'll stop destructin
These blocks are not for frontin', So let me get that shorty
Cause you don't need that shorty
you don't know what to do with that shorty
You might as well hit this 40, before you hit the floor
Another 24, What you want, Money, More!?!
