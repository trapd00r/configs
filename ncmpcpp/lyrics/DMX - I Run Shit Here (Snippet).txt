I run shit here, Y'all just sit here (what?)
Do y'all niggaz know what it took for me to get here (woo!)
I'm gonna stay here, (yeah!) earn my way here (yeah!)
You can fuck around if you want but we don't play here (c'mon!)
We get through that, (uh!) run right through that (uh!)
That's how we do that, (uh!) y'all niggaz knew that (uh!)
Two albums in one year three albums in two
Didn't I just fucking tell y'all niggaz that's how we do (c'mon!)
You wasn't even fucking listening when I just said
What I said, you get that, what I just said (c'mon!)
I run shit here fuck y'all niggaz (woo!)
Jail what I said I used to duck y'all niggaz (c'mon!)
Motherfucker I'm grown and that's all to it (uh!)
Y'all leave a child on his own and I'm gonna do it (yeah!)
Fuck I done did it, shit it
you ain't even half way close to being with it forget it (c'mon!)

[Chorus]
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit here, I run shit
