Then there was rain 
The sky wore a veil of gold and green 
At night it was the bright of a lonely day 
Time is just floating away 

Then there was rain 
The sound foundations are crumbling 
Through the ground comes a bit of a-tumbling 
And time was just floating away 
What could we say? 
And we can listen 

Oh rainy day, come around 
Sometimes i just want it to slow down 
And we're separated now, I'm down 
But I love it when you come over to the house 
I love it when you come over to my house 

Then there was rain 
I spent the night with the Queen of Spain 
My lonely little heart would have broke again 
Times so vicious 
Saying deeper that the knife goes in, the more you win 
You end up with less than when you begin 
Deeper that the knife goes in 

Oh rainy day, come around 
Sometimes I just want it to slow down 
And we're separated now, I'm down 
But I love it when you come over to the house 
I love it when you come over to my house
