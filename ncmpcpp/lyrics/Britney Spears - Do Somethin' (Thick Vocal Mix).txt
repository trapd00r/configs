Do you feel this? 
I'm gonna feel this 
Are you ready? 
I don't think so 

Somebody give me my truck 
So I can ride on the clouds 
So I can turn up the pace, like...

Somebody pass my guitar 
So I can look like a star 
And spend the cash, like...

What you gonna do when the crowd goes "eoh" 
Why you standing on the wall? 
Music's starting everywhere
So why don't you just move along? 

I see you looking at me 
Like I'm some kind of a freak 
Get up out of your seat 
Why don't you do somethin'? 

I see you looking at me 
Like I got what you need 
Get up out of your seat 
Why don't you do somethin'? 

Now you all in my grill 
Cause I say what I feel 
Only rock to what's real 
Bum bum

But I can't do that with you 
I'll be here with my crew 
You can roll if you can 
Don't be a bum bum

What you gonna do when the crowd goes "eoh" 
Why you standing on the wall
Music's starting everywhere
So why don't you just move along

I see you looking at me 
Like I'm some kind of a freak 
Get up out of your seat 
Why don't you do somethin'?

I see you looking at me 
Like I got what you need 
Get up out of your seat 
Why don't you do somethin'? 

I see you looking at me 
Like I'm some kind of a freak 
Get up out of your seat 
Why don't you do somethin'?

(Na na na na na na na) (x3) (Uh-huh)
(Na na na na na na na) (x3)

I see you lookin' over here 
Can't you tell I'm having fun? 
If you know it like I know 
You would stop! 
Let's turn it up! 
And get you into space 
And do somethin'! 

I see you looking at me 
Like I'm some kind of a freak 
Get up out of your seat 
Why don't you do somethin'?

I see you looking at me 
Like I got what you need 
Get up out of your seat 
Why don't you do somethin'? 

I see you looking at me 
Like I'm some kind of a freak 
Get up out of your seat 
Why don't you do somethin'? 

Fuck!
Do somethin'!
Why don't you do somethin'?!
