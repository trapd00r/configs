ah, ah ah 
ah, ah ah 

They say 
I'm away 
Because I'm down with you everyday 
They say 
Break away 
I'm missing out on the fun and games 

But you smile 
And the words they tell me 
Quickly disappear 
You speak and there is no other 
Voice that I can hear 

(Chorus) 
I spend my days (oh, oh) (all day all night) 
With you 
I spend my nights (My nights) 
Thinkin' about you (2x) 

You stepped on 
On my mind 
And I think about you 
All the time 
Day and night 
Feels so right 
And for us there is no end in sight 

Each day that I spend around you 
Passes by too fast 
Each night 
That I spend without you 
Is longer than the last 

Chorus 

Ohh, 
You know I can't get enough of you 
(can't get enough yeah) (Uh, Uh) 
You know that twenty-four hours won't ever ever do 

(Chorus)(5x's)
