I feel better
I feel better, now, you've gone
I got better
I got better, I got strong

I feel better
I feel better, now, there's nothing wrong
I got better
I got better, now, I got strong

Tell me something
Tell me something, I don't know
Tell me one thing
Tell me one thing, and let it go

I got something
I got something, heaven knows
I got something
I got something, I don't know
