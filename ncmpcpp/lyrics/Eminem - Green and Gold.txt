What would it take to push a man, far enough
To put somethin' material over a human life?
What would drive someone completely over the edge
To do some shit like that?
The green and gold.

I done filled my lungs up
With so much of this crack smoke
My necks bloated, my tech's loaded
I'm flat broke, and I'm pissed off
Mad at the world I've had it with girls
And I'm frustrated, ran to the bus stop
Just made it and hopped on
Ready to drop bombs on the first person
Who had a nice suit and a watch on
I spot John, a white collar worker
In clean cut, walked up to 'em
He was like, "What?"
Whatchu mean what?
You know what time it is, man
At your next stop gimme that Rolex watch
With that diamond wrist band
Got his green and his gold, dashed it,
Climbed in his van to steal it and seen
A man holdin a nine and then
Shot him from the bottom up
Stole his keys, put 'em inside the ignition and got 'em stuck
Hopped out to flee on my feet
Fucked around, forgot that I left my ID on the seat
