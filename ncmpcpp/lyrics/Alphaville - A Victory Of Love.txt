Waiting for a change in the weather
I'm waiting for a shift in the air,
Could we get it together, ever
Hoping for your return
Hoping for your sweet, sweet return 

Hello, is this heaven calling?
Hello, hello
Is somebody there?
She must be somewhere
And then she says
Hello, hello, hello
She's really an angel
She stands in the sunshine
She's closing her eyes
She's starting to dream
She's pulling the strings
She's dreaming a strange dream
Where nothing is grey
Then she takes me away
And she's pulling the strings
When she's playing with love 

Hello, hello
She's playing with love
Hello, hello
She's playing with love
Hello, hello
She's playing with love
Hello, hello
Ah, she's playing with love
Hello, hello
She's playing with love
Hello, hello
She's playing with love

Counting, I count every second
And I'm standing
I stand in the rain,
I walk up that lane
Which leads to the sunshine
She stands in the sunshine
She's closing her eyes
Then she takes me away
And she's pulling the strings
When she's playing with love 

Hello, hello
She's playing with love
Hello, hello
She's playing with love
Hello, hello
She's playing with love
Hello, hello
Ah, she's playing with love
Hello, hello
She's playing with love
Hello, hello
She's playing with love
