Summertime, time, time
Child, the living's easy
Fish are jumping out
And the cotton, Lord
Cotton's high, Lord so high

Your daddy's rich
And your ma is so good-looking, baby
She's a-looking good now
Hush, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
No, no, no, no, don't you cry, don't you cry


One of these mornings
You're gonna rise, rise up singing
You're gonna spread your wings, child
And take, take to the sky
Lord, the sky

Until that morning
Honey, nothing's going to harm you now
No, no, no no, no no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no no, no no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't you cry
