Ah yeah...
Uhh
Uhh
Hollar if Ya Hear me

Yeah...

Here we go
Turn it up
Let's start
From block ta block
We're snatchin' hearts 
And jackin' marks 
And tha punk police can't fade me 
And maybe 
We can have peace someday 'G' 
But right now I got my mind set up 
Lookin down tha barrell of my 9 
Get up 
Cause it's time to make tha pay back phat 
To my brothers on tha block--better stay strapped black 
And accept no substitutes 
I bring truth to tha youth tear tha roof off tha ol' school

Oh no, I won't turn tha other cheek 
In case ya can't see us while we burn the other week 
Now we gotta make it smash 
Blast 
How long will it last, till tha broke get more cash 
Until then 
Raise up! 
Tell my young black males 
Blaze up! 
Lifes a mess don't stress 
Test 
I'm givin 
Much love to my brothers in tha pen 
See ya when I free ya 
If not, when they shut me in 
Once again, is there no one else strapped 
Keep ya hands on ya gat 
Now ya boys watch ya back 
Cause in tha alleys of cali i'ma tell ya 
Mess with tha best and tha vest couldn't help ya 
Scream, if ya feel me 
See it clearly? your too near me  

Hollar if Ya Hear me
Hollar if Ya Hear me
Hollar if Ya Hear me

Pump ya fists like this
Hollar if ya hear me 
(pump, pump) if ya pissed
To tha sell-outs livin' it up
One way or another you'll be givin it up
I guess cause i'm black boy
I'm supposed to say 'peace', sing songs, and get capped on

But it's time for tha new plan, BAM!
I'll be swingin' like a one man clan
Here we go 
Turn it up
Don't stop
To my homies on tha block
Gettin' dropped by cops
I'm still around for ya
Keepin' my sound
Underground for ya
And i'ma throw a changup
Quayle, like you never brought my name up
Now my homies in tha backstreets
Tha blackstreets
They fear me when they rollin in they phat jeeps
This ain't just a rap song
A black song
Tellin all my brothers, get they strap on
And look for me in tha struggle
Hustlin' to tha other brotha's bubble
 
Hollar if Ya Hear me
Hollar if Ya Hear me
Hollar if Ya Hear me

Will I quit, will I quit?
They claimin' that i'm violent
But still I kick
Representin'
Never give up on a good thing
Wouldn't stop it if we could
It's a hood thing
And now i'm like a major threat
'Cause I remind you of the things you were made to forget
Bring tha noise
To all my boyz
Know tha real from tha bustas
And the decoys
And if ya hustle like a real 'G'
Pump ya fists if ya feel me
Hollar if Ya Hear me
Learn to survive in tha nine-tre
I make crime pay
I was in crime pay
Whatever it takes to make a stand
Cause nobody else'l give a damn
So we live like caged beasts
Waitin' for tha day to let tha rage free
Still me, till they kill me
I love it when they fear me
Hollar if Ya Hear me 

Hollar if Ya Hear me
Hollar if Ya Hear me
Hollar if Ya Hear me
