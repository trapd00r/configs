It ain’t how you die, it’s how you breathe 
It ain’t what you take, it’s what you leave and conceive 
What you got is nothing if your soul don’t represent it 
Present it, it ain’t where you’re from, it’s where you been, kid

Eh yo Slug, I used to know this girl named Dawn 
Back in the day she had love and everybody was fond 
See Dawn was the bomb, her attitude it was calm 
Her heart was warm though with the wrong peeps she tagged along 
Now she’s gone, long passed away 
She kicked it with this kid named Andre who lived life the wrong way

[Slug]

I know that kid, seemed as if he had no insecurities 
Acted like he was the mac mixed with Hercules 
Disturbingly flow just to hold the title “Fly cool” 
The first one to tow the tool freshman year in high school 
Now mind you, this was back a decade 
We was thinking girls, music, shoes, Andre was thinking get paid 
But let’s say my man just had a knack for acting ill 
To the level of immaculate as if it was a practiced skill 
He’d have to fill your head with tales 
Keep a rep from getting stale 
Fourteen, said he spent his winter break in jail 
As time goes by, the lines that try to differentiate 
The fake from truth get loose so what’s the use? 
Kid was living on the rails cause he chooses to 
Goes to jail, comes back with juice, cruising ? 
Who knew the bruise would heal so quick? 
Who knew the passion would become fashion 
And get you fastened onto his dick? 
You might as well have let him penetrate 
The situation shook me, looking at rookies that try to emulate 
One sets the standard, the weak randomly follow 
Space ain’t shit, some kid’ll take your place tomorrow 
The cycle never stops cause you can’t recycle styrofoam 
I still see Andre nowadays, he fucks with microphones

Man, they lied, it ain’t how you die, it’s how you breathe 
It ain’t what you take, it’s what you leave and conceive 
What you got is nothing if your soul don’t represent it 
Present it, it ain’t where you’re from, it’s where you been, kid

[Slug]

They lied, it ain’t how you die, it’s how you breathe 
It ain’t what you take, it’s what you leave and conceive 
What you got is nothing if your soul don’t represent it 
Present it, it ain’t where you’re from, it’s where you been, kid 
What you got ain’t nothing if your soul don’t represent it 
Present it, it ain’t where you’re from, it’s where you been, kid 
What you got is nothing if your soul don’t represent it 
Present it, it ain’t where you’re from, it’s where you been, kid

[Spawn]

They lied, it ain’t how you die, it’s how you breathe 
It ain’t what you take, it’s what you leave and conceive 
What you got is nothing if your soul don’t represent it 
Present it, it ain’t where you’re from, it’s where you been, kid

[Slug]

But the sun will come out tomorrow 
And you can bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow 
There’ll be someone that’s harder than me and smarter than me 
And stronger than me and lasts longer than me 
So check my fate, wide awake but feels like I’m sleeping 
Trife life can’t catch a wife that’s really worthy my keeping 
It’s deeper, I peep it, I seem to need to understand 
How am I gonna explain to my seed I was the man?

? suicide in crystal court buildings 
Young villains holding guns without feelings 
Dealing crumbs of demons to those fiending  
Lost in dreams when the pressure hit 
I mean the fan hit the shit but when the shit hit the fan that was it 
Flipped out, you tripped out, you couldn’t handle it 
Addicted to life dismantlement 
? from distortion to brain abortion forcing to perish 
Life’s to cherish, the moments too little 
The path is brittle for those who chose to walk hard 
In regards to those who front, stunts get elderly 
Propelling me to disappointment, could’ve been avoided 
By egos posing lethal with weapons 
Deceptions are ill, revolve around intentions to kill 
Gots to chill on that level or end up with the Devil 
Digging your grave somewhere in the middle

[Slug]

It’s no riddle, they lied 
It ain’t how you die, it’s how you breathe 
It ain’t what you take, it’s what you leave and conceive 
What you got is nothing if your soul don’t represent it 
Present it, it ain’t where you’re from, it’s where you been, kid

They lie, it ain’t how you die, it’s how you breathe

What you got is nothing if your soul don’t represent it 
Present it, it ain’t where you’re from, it’s where you been, kid 
What you got is nothing if your soul don’t represent it 
Present it
