High 'Til I Die
Loced 'Til they smoke me
The Shit don't stop
Til my casket drop
I'm High 'Til I Die
Loced 'Til they smoke me
The Shit don't stop
Til my casket drop
I'm High 'Til I Die
Loced 'Til they smoke me
Shit don't stop
The shit don't stop

Game rules
Ain't got time for fools
Money on my mind
So my nine rules
Time to make wieght
Niggas gettin' crazy paid
Hate bitches for the games they play
So nigga
Pull quick
But better be quicker
Than the next mutha fucka 
On the trigger
Cause I'm static
Startin' to be a fuckin' habit
Gotta keep my automatic
Or get my ass kicked
When I'm travelin'
It's kind of puffin'
I drive a bucket
Little Thug Life nigga 
Screaming Fuck It
I love to throw my middle finger to the police
And no bucks, no justice, no peace
I'm smoking blunts 'til I pass out
[coughing]
Yah nigga getting assed out
Rollin' and my niggas
Glass out
Drving fast
Talking to bitches
Whipping cash out
I'm with my niggas
So fuck the suckas
I'm bucking brothas
Smokin' chronic mutha fuckas
Causing ruckus
It's the last of the drank
Pull over 
Can't hear a damn thang
Sober

High 'Til I Die
Loced 'Til they smoke me
The Shit don't stop
Til my casket drop
I'm High 'Til I Die
Loced 'Til they smoke me
The Shit don't stop
Til my casket drop
High 'Til I Die
Loced 'Til they smoke me
The Shit don't stop
Til my casket drop
I'm High 'Til I Die
Loced 'Til they smoke me
Shit don't stop
The shit don't stop

Lord help me save me
Mama keep praying for a young mutha fucker
Trying to duck an early grave
In the city where you can't tell the fakes
From the snakes
Enemies from phonies
Friends from your homies
Around the corner theres another nigga waiting to jack
He don't know I got a glock
Till his ass get shot
Like a mutha fuckin' Thug disease
Claiming Peace
Like they mutha fuckin' trustin' me
Hey, what's up with bitches trying to screw me
Do me cause I did a movie
Throw the pussy to me
But before they never knew me
Rather die then let yah 
Play me for like a Busta
And with my glock
I'm a plotin' ass rotten mutha fucka
Hey don't let that movie fool yah
Let me school yah
Screaming Thug Life nigga 
When I do yah
It's the last of the drank
Pull over
Can't hear a damn thang 
Sober

[Till the end of song]
High 'Til I Die
Loced 'Til they smoke me
The Shit don't stop
Til my casket drop
