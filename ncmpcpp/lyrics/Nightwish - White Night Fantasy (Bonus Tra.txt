Enchantress 
Came to me 
And said
"Meet me 
At the lake 
Tonight"

I hummed 
This song 
To the white
Through the shroud of snow 
I saw
Paradise
Peace
No more lies

Crestfallen soul
Rest for this night
Love is here
Right here under my wings

I dream 
Of wolves, with them 
I run
For me she lengthened 
The night
I am home
I am in peace

Crestfallen soul
Rest for this night
Love is here
Right here under my wings


Crestfallen soul
Rest for this night
Love is here
Right here under my wings

Crestfallen soul
Rest for this night
Love is here
Right here under my wings

Crestfallen soul
Rest for this night
Love is here
Right here under my wings
