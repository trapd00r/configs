I'm just bein' real, you know
I'm like the sun, I'm tryin' to shine on everybody
You know what I'm sayin'
But it's like situation after situation, you know
So I write about it to get it off my chest, you heard

Dear mama, you wouldn't believe what I'm goin' through
But still I got my head up just like I promised you
Every since you left your baby, boy's been dealin'with
Problem after problem, tell me what am I supposed to do
See, I get lost sometimes, don't understand this place
Look in the mirror sometimes and see a troubled face
And then my tears roll down and hit the sink
Then I hold my head up high, I hope the Man upstairs can hear my cry
All these questions deep inside my mind
Like if Jesus loved me, why he leave my side, mama
I'm still tryin' to get the answer why
You were young, 45, and you had to die
I'm always tryin' to help people out
And it's them same people tryin' to take food out my mouth

(Fo' real tho') It seems like the more money I make
(Fo' real tho') The more drama y'all try to create
(Fo' real tho') And through I try to move into the positive
(Fo' real tho') The more y'all don't wanna let me live

When will you realize that I don't owe you nothin'
Need to get up off your butt and go get your own somethin'
I'm pullin' on my hair to keep from snappin' off
Fools ride up in my camp and be actin' off
Somebody out there please pray what I'm talkin' 'bout
Still young tryin' to figure it out

Heaven, I need a hug
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug
Feelin' like a change of heart
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God
So shower down on me, wet me with your love
I need you to take me and lift me up, oh, yeah

I gave 13 years of my life to this industry
Hit song or not, I've given all of me
You smile in my face and tell me that you love
But then before you know the truth, you're so quick to judge me
That's alright, go ahead, keep talkin'
'Cause I'mma hold my head up high and keep walkin'
And reach for the sky, focus on the plan
Rescue the kid with his paper a pen
And this is for the homies that we lost
Yo', we cannot forget y'all, so the hats come off
We pour a little liquor out for the memory
I know y'all up there sittin' on chrome in them pearly streets
The street survivors before careful, stay alive
I'm prayin' for your families, I hope you pray for mine

(Fo' real tho') Used to be a time you wished me well
(Fo' real tho') It hurts to know you wanna see me fail
(Fo' real tho') And don't forget I kept you out of jail
(Fo' real tho') Where's my arms when you needed to be held

They turn they backs on you, who was there believin'
Who said your troubles were only for a season
In church together tryin' to pick up all the pieces
And now you betray me, I bind you in the name of Jesus
Somebody please pray what I'm talkin' 'bout
Still young tryin' to figure it all out

Heaven, I need a hug
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug
Feelin' like a change of heart
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God
(Please shower down)
So shower down on me, wet me with your love (Yeah)
I need you to take me and lift me up (Oh...oh...yeah, yeah, yeah)

Man, I tell you it's enough to make you wanna give it up
Thank God for my fans 'cause through it all they show me love
To my sister and to brothers
Tell me why can't we just try to get along with one another
And stop hurtin' one another, fightin' one another
Man, I pray to God He get my family back together
Let me see what wanna see, just to blind me
All of these luxuries, wine and dining
And then You push me out in front to get behind me
Then You sat me up by blessin' me to bind me
I'm a grown man with kids now, stakes are high
Gotta go to church now to avoid the fight
Frankly, y'all to keep it real I'm just tired
Have dreams of bein' dead, but the devil is alive

(Fo' real tho') Church folks, you need to stop judgin'
(Fo' real tho') Or you will be the first to be judged
(Fo' real tho') And women stop dependin' on us men
(Fo' real tho') And start dependin' on the Man above, feel me

And as for robbin', here's what I need to do
Get rid of them clowns and get myself a whole 'nother crew
Media, do your job
But please just don't make my job so hard
Somebody please pray what I'm talkin' 'bout
I'm still young tryin' to figure it all out

Heaven, I need a hug
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug
Feelin' like a change of heart
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God
So shower down on me (Shower down on me now), wet me with your love
I need you to take me (Please) and lift me up, yeah,
yeah (Said I'm callin' on heaven)

Heaven, I need a hug
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug
Feelin' like a change of heart
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God
So shower down on me, wet me with your love
I need you to take me and lift me up (Lift me up),
yeah, yeah (Heaven I need)

Heaven, I need a hug (Ooh, yeah, yeah)
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug
Said I'm Feelin' like a change of heart (Hey)
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God (Ooh, yeah)
So shower down on me (Shower down), wet me with your love (Take me)
I need you to take me and lift me up, yeah, yeah
