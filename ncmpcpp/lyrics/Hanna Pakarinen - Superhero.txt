I miss the girl I used to be 
So full of life that so cant be 
Untouchable, complete control 
She had it all 
She wrapped her heart in armour 
No one could touch her, harm her 
She liked that feeling without that fear of getting hurt 
No it's just no fun 2x 

Chorus: 
'I used to be a superhero 
Now look at me 
A shadow of my self 
I used to be a Wonder woman 
Now look at me 
I'm like everybody else 

I'm losing it all when you're inside 
I can't hold back 
I can not find 
Some kind of friend tonight' 

She used to be the tuff kind 
No one could mess with her mind 
They tried to break her armour chest 
She ate their kind for breakfast 
Now she's gone 
What have you done? 

Chorus 

Why can't we all admit it? 
I get weak when I'm alone with you 
With both feet I'm in it 
Living, loving every minute of it 

I still miss the girl I used to be (I still miss the girl I used to be) 
Now she's gone 
What have you done?
