Uh huh, yeah

Let's go round again
Maybe we'll turn back the hands of time
Let's go round again
One More time

Baby I'm back (yeah)
And right away I had to come to you
To see if the love that we knew before
Had passed the test of time (uh, huh, huh)

Time it changes almost everything
Sometimes I don't see the better side
Of the feelings we once shared

So baby

Chorus
Lets go round again
Maybe we'll turn back the hands of time
Let's go round again
One more time (woah woah woah woah)
Let's go round again
Maybe we'll turn back the hands of time
Let's go round again
One more time
One more time

Now, baby I know (yeah)
That you think I will different now
Inside of me nothing has changed
So I'm asking you again

Uh huh, please
No one else that could have brought me 
back
No one else could ever shake me free
Of the memory I kept within my heart

So baby

Chorus

Ooh, huh huh, yeah
Ooh, go round again
Ooh, one more time

Let's go round again
(Let's go round again)
Maybe we'll turn back the hands of time
(One more time)
Let's go round again
One more time
(Let's go round again)
One more time
(oooh)
