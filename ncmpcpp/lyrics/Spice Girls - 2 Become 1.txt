Candlelight and soul forever
A dream of you and me together
Say you believe it, say you believe it

Free your mind of doubt and danger
Be for real, don't be a stranger
We can achieve it, we can achieve it

Come a little bit closer, baby, get it on, get it on
'Cause tonight is the night when two become one

I need some love like I never needed love before
(Wanna make love to ya, baby)
I had a little love, now I'm back for more
(Wanna make love to ya, baby)
Set your spirit free, it's the only way to be

Silly games that you were playin'
Empty words we both were sayin'
Let's work it out, boy, let's work it out, boy

Any deal that we endeavour
Boys and girls go good together
Take it or leave it, take it or leave it

Are you as good as I remember, baby?
Get it on, get it on
'Cause tonight is the night when two become one

I need some love like I never needed love before
(Wanna make love to ya, baby)
I had a little love, now I'm back for more
(Wanna make love to ya, baby)
Set your spirit free, it's the only way to be

Be a little bit wiser, baby, put it on, put it on
'Cause tonight is the night when two become one

I need some love like I never needed love before
(Wanna make love to ya, baby)
I had a little love, now I'm back for more
(Wanna make love to ya, baby)

I need some love like I never needed love before
(Wanna make love to ya, baby)
I had a little love, now I'm back for more
(Wanna make love to ya, baby)

Set your spirit free, it's the only way to be
It's the only way to be
It's the only way to be
