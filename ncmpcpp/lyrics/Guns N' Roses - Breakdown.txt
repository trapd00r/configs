Ain't it fun when you're always on the run
Ain't it fun when you're friends despise what you become
Ain't it fun when you get so high, well that you, you just can't come
Ain't it fun when you know that you gonna die young

It's such fun, good fun, such fun, such fun, aah such fun
Such fun, fun aah, yeah, fun, just fun, such...

Ain't it fun when you take care of number one
Oh ain't it fun when you feel like you just gotta get a gun
Ain't it fun when you just can't seem to find your tongue
'Cause you stuck it too deep into something that really stung

It's such fun, ah

Well, so good to me, they spit right in my face
And I didn't even feel it, it was such a disgrace
I punched my fist right through the glass
And I didn't even feel it, it happened so fast
Such fun, such fun, such fun
Ah such fun, such fun, such fun
Ah such fun

Ain't it fun when you tell her she's just a cunt
Ain't it fun when you she splits you and leaves you on a bum
Well, ain't it fun when you've broken up every band you've ever begun
Ain't it fun when you know that you're gonna die young

It's such fun
Such fun
