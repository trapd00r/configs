No more tears and you'll be fine
I stay here all night
And when I've stayed all night
We go out in the morning light

And then you try to live the day
I don't know how, but I know what to say
Is it medicine or social skill
Don't have the answer and nobody will
You go screaming on without a word
Being sad is a fulltime  work
And now the day has come to an end
And then you start to cry again

Is it medicine?
Is it medicine, is it medicine or social skill?
Is it medicine, is it medicine, is it medicine or social skill?
