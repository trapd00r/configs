I've been thinking about you, my love
And all the crazy things that you put me through
Now I'm coming around, Throwing it back to you
Were you thinking of me when you kissed him
Could you taste me when you licked his skin
All the while I showered you with trust and promises
What I'm needing now is some sweet revenge
To get back all that I lost then
I gave you all I had to give, but I could never reach you

(Chorus:)
Adrienne, I thought I knew you
Once again, you used me, used me
Adrienne, I should have left you
Long before you used me, used me up

Spent my money, drove my car
I treated you like a shining star
But in my sky all burnt out you are
And I'll have the last laugh
When I see you walking with some other guy
'Cause I know you're gonna end up all alone
So take these words, some good advice
All you've done gonna come back twice
You never cared how much it hurt, I really need to tell you

(Chorus)

What I'm needing now's some sweet revenge
To get back all that I lost then
I gave you all that I had to give
But I could never reach you

(Chorus)
