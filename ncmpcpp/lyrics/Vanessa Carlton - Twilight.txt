I was stained with a role in a day not my own
As you walked into my life
You showed what needed to be shown 
I always knew what was right
I just didn't know that I might 
Peel away and choose to see with such a different sight

CHORUS:
And I will never see the sky the same way
And I will learn to say good-bye to yesterday
And I will never cease to fly if held down
And I will always reach too high 
'Cause I've seen, 'cause I've seen
Twilight

Never cared, never wanted, never sought to see what flaunted 
So on purpose, so in my face, couldn't see beyond my own place
And it was so easy not to behold what I could hold 
But you taught me I could change whatever came within these shallow days

And I will never see the sky the same way
And I will learn to say good-bye to yesterday
And I will never cease to fly if held down
And I will always reach too high 
'Cause I've seen, 'cause I've seen...

As the sun shines through it pushes away and pushes ahead
It fills the warmth of blue and leaves a chill instead
And I didn't know that I could be so blind to all that is so real
But as illusion dies I see there is so much to be revealed

CHORUS

I was stained by a role in a day not my own
But as you walked into my life
You showed what needed to be shown
I always knew what was right
I just didn't know that I might 
Peel away and choose to see with such a different sight

CHORUS
