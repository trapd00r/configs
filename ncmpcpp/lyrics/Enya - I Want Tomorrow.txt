Dawn breaks, there is blue in the sky.
Your face before me
Though I don't know why.
Thoughts disappearing like tears from the Moon. 

Waiting here, as I sit by the stone,
They came before me
Those men from the Sun.
Signs from the heavens say I am the one. 
 
Now you're here, I can see your light,
This light that I must follow.
You, you may take my life away, so far away.
Now I know I must leave your spell
I want tomorrow. 

Now you're here, I can see your light,
This light that I must follow.
You, you may take my life away, so far away.
Now I know I must leave your spell
I want tomorrow.
