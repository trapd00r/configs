Oooh, yeah...
Hush, just stop
There's nothing you can do or say
Baby
I've had enough
I'm not your property as from today
Baby
You might think that I won't make it on my own

But now I'm stronger than yesterday
Now it's nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
I'm stronger

Than I ever thought that I could be
Baby
I used to go with the flow
Didn't really care 'bout me
You might think that I can't take it
But you're wrong

'Cause now I'm stronger than yesterday
Now it's nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
I'm stronger

Come on, now
Oh, yeah
Here I go, on my own
I don't need nobody, better off alone
Here I go, on my own now
I don't need nobody, not anybody
Here I go...
Alright...
Here I go...

Stronger than yesterday
It's nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
I'm stronger than yesterday
Now it's nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
But now I'm stronger than yesterday
Now it's nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
I'm stronger
