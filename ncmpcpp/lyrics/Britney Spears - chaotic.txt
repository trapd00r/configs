There's too much of this noise
Boy, let's get a seat
So you can talk sweet to me
I see these other boys
Won't you get me on the dancefloor?
Kinda like to buy me drinks

Movin' so sexy
Kinda wonderin'
How we can have some fun
So don't be shy
Baby just enjoy 
What's on your mind, party 
And have a good time

It's getting hectic in here
It's getting chaotic
I'm rockin' and rollin' 
No stoppin'
We goin' 'til it's over

Do you like the way I rock it?
Boy I think it's so chaotic

Oh, goin' wild
I'm on fire
(Burning up the dancefloor)
Turn it up higher
Wild like a tiger
(Tell me do you want more?)

Everybody blink your lights
Party from the left to right
Oh, I'm on fire
Oh, I'm on fire
(Burning up the dancefloor)
Do you like the way I rock it
Boy it's chaotic

There's too much of the sound
I'm with the crowd
So please don't turn me down
I'm havin' so much fun
And being done 
I'm gonna tell you off

The DJ is my friend
So lets begin
I'm a do my dance 
Until the end
Baby lets get down 
Let's get the town 
Everybody here's getting' wild

It's getting hectic in here
It's getting chaotic
I'm rockin' and rollin' 
No stoppin'
We goin' 'til it's over

Do you like the way I rock it
Boy I think it's so chaotic

Oh, goin' wild
I'm on fire
(Burning up the dancefloor)
Turn it up higher
Wild like a tiger
(Tell me do you want more?)

Everybody blink your lights
Party from the left to right
Oh, I'm on fire
Oh, I'm on fire
(Burning up the dance floor)
Do you like the way I rock it
Boy it's chaotic
