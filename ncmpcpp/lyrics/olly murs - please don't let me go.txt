Where do I begin?
Should I tell you
How bad I need you now
You're underneath my skin
But I'm confused
My head is spinning all around
I waited so long
I need to know, darling
What is on your mind
Normally I try to run
And I might even want to hide
Cause I never knew what I wanted
Til I looked into your eyes
So am I in this alone?
What I'm looking for is a sign
That you feel how I feel for you
Baby please don't let me go
Baby please don't let me go
Baby please don't let me go
No, please don't let me go
Baby no, no, no, no
Badabadeebaba
What else can I say? (Can I say)
My heart is beating double time, yeah
And do you feel the same? (Do you feel the same)
Don't leave me in the dark, no
But baby don't put out this spark, no
I waited so long
I need to know, darling
What is on your mind
Normally I try to run
And I might even want to hide
Cause I never knew what I wanted
Til I looked into your eyes
So am I in this alone?
What I'm looking for is a sign
That you feel how I feel for you
Baby please don't let me go
Baby please don't let me go
Baby please don't let me go
No, please don't let me go
Baby no, no, no, no
Caught in the inquisition
Under these conditions
I need a definition
Is it love that we're sharing
Show me that you're caring
You see my fascination
Tell me I'm not mistaken
Give me the information I need
1, 2, 3
Normally I try to run
And I might even want to hide
Cause I never knew what I wanted
Til I looked into your eyes
So am I in this alone?
What I'm looking for is a sign
That you feel how I feel for you
Baby please don't let me go (Don't let me go)
Baby please don't let me go (Please don't let me go)
Baby please don't let me go (Don't let me go)
No, please don't let me go
Baby no, no, no, no
