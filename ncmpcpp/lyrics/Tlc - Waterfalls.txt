Send "Waterfalls" Ringtone to your Cell A lonely mother gazing out of her window 
staring at a son that she just can't touch.
If at any time he's in a jam she'll be by his side, 
but he doesn't realize he hurts her so much.
But all the praying just ain't helping at all, 
'cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble.
So, he goes out and he makes his money the best way he know how,
another body laying cold in the gutter.
Listen to me.
 
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, 
but I think you're moving too fast.
 
Little precious has a nat'ral obsession for temptation, 
but he just can't see.
She give him loving that his body can't handle, 
but all he can say is, "Baby, it's good to me."
One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror, 
but he doesn't recognize his own face.
His health is fading and he doesn't know why.
Three letters took him to his final resting place.
Y'all don't hear me.
 
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, 
but I think you're moving too fast.
 
I seen rainbow yesterday
But too many storms have come and gone
Leavin' a trace of not on God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray all ten fade away
Seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like His promise is true
Only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew
To bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries
My only bleedin' hope
Is for the folk who can't cope
Wit such an endurin' pain
That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame
For tootin' caine in your own vein
What a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane
And name this day in time
For fallin prey to crime
I say the system got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of comin' true
Believe in yourself
The rest is up to me and you
