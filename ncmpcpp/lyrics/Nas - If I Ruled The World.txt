Nas
featuring Lauryn Hill 

Intro: Nas (Lauryn Hill singing in the background) 

Life..... I wonder.... 
Will it take me under.... I dt know 

Verse One: Nas 

Imagine smoking weed in the streets without cops harassing 
Imagine going to court with no trial 
Lifestyle cruising blue Bahama waters 
No welfare supporters more conscious of the way we raise our daughters 
Days are shorter nights are colder 
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra 
The world's hot my son got knocked evidently 
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually 
Trooping out of state for a plate of knowledge 
if coke was cooked without the garbage we'd all have the top dollars 
Imagine everybody flashing, fashion 
Designer clothes, lacing your clique up with diamond Role's
Your people holding dough, no parole 
No rubbers, going  raw imagine law with no undercovers 
Just some thoughts for the mind 
I take a glimpse into time, watch the blimp read "The World Is Mine" 

Chorus: Lauryn Hill, Nas 

If I ruled the world Imagine that 
I'd free all my sons, I love em love em baby 
Black diamonds and pearls Could it be, if you could 
be mine, we'd both shine 
If I ruled the world Still living for today, in 
these last days and times 

Verse Two: Nas 

Yo it'll be, paradise life relaxing black, Latino and Anglo-saxon 
Armani exchange the Range
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last 
Brand new whips to crash then we laugh in the iller path 
The Villa houses for the crew, how we do 
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches 
So many years of depression make me vision 
The better living, type of place to raise kids in 
Open they eyes to the lies history's told foul 
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child 
Seeing things like I was controlling, clique rolling 
Tricking six digits on kicks and still holding
Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage 
Gimme one shot I turn trife life to lavish 
Political prisoner set free, stress free 
No work release purple M3's and jet skis 
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies 
I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities and reverse fiends to Willies 
It sounds foul but every girl I meet will go down town 
I'd open every cell in Attica send 'em to Africa 

Chorus: Lauryn Hill, Nas 

If I ruled the world Imagine that 
I'd free all my sons, I love em love em baby 
Black diamonds and pearls Could it be, if you could 
be mine, we'd both shine 
If I ruled the world Still livin for today, in 
these last days and times 

And then we'll walk right up to the sun 
Hand in hand 
We'll walk right up to the sun 
We won't land 
We'll walk right up to the sun 
Hand in hand 
We'll walk right up to the sun 
We won't land 

Verse Three: Nas 

You'd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry 
Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory 
Running from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes 
These are the breaks many mistakes go down out of state 
Wait, I had to let it marinate we carry weight 
Trying to get laced, flip the ace stack the safe 
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
Making moves in Atlanta, back and forth scrambler 
Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich 
Still nobody want a nigga having shit 
If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit 
I push a Q-45 Infiniti
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or B Felonies 
Strictly living longevity to the destiny 
I thought I'd never see but reality struck 
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck??? 

Chorus: Lauryn Hill, Nas 

If I ruled the world Imagine that 
I'd free all my sons, I love em em baby 
Black diamonds and pearls Could it be, if you could 
be mine, we'd both shine 
If I ruled the world Still livin for today, in 
these last days and times 

If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled Imagine that 
I'd free all my sons, if I ruled, if I ruled 
I love em love em baby 
Black diamonds and pearls, black dimaonds Could it be, if you could 
black diamonds be mine, we'd both shine 
If I ruled the world Still livin for today, in 
these last days and times 

If I ruled the world, if I ruled 
if I ruled, I'd free all my sons 
black diamonds, I love em love em baby 
Black diamonds and pearls, if I ruled 
If I ruled the world 

If I ruled the world 
I love em love em baby!!
