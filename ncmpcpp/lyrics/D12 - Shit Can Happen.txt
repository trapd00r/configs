Shit can happen
Shit can happeeen
Shit can happen
Shit can happeeen
Shit can happen
Shit can happeeen
Shit can happen
Shit can happeeen

(Kon Artis)
Yo, that's right motherfuckers we back
Same slanging
Orangutaning
Wilding out on hoodrats that say I act
Like I'm too famous
To say hi and tell 'em what My Name Is
But really I'm still nameless
You niggas don't get it yet do you?
Kill or not
Platinum or flop
I'll still put it through you
With a luger that'll spit fire
And hit higher
Than a pitch by a bitch like Mariah
You think for one second since we got a deal
That we won't deal with you in front of St. Andrew's still
You gay rappers better learn that
I won't stop until I see 'em turn back
If you don't slow that road you pack
You gon' see these Runyan Ave. niggas
That really need some Prozac
To show that ask the others
Brigade'll lay you down
Next to your mother's mother's grandmothers

(Kuniva)
You know I'm feeling real rowdy tonight
Ready to fight
And half the niggas I give DAT to
I don't even like
The same cat who never gave a damn about your name
I gives a fuck about it
Like the next L.A. Clippers game
I'll kill you in ways you couldn't even fathom
You and yo' madam
It's really unexplainable how I have 'em
Who call theyselves screaming about a challenge
Nigga we got a gift while you barely making it off of mere talent
My skills are deeply imbedded
Even your hoe said it
She was knock-kneed
I fucked her now she bow-legged
In the middle of rapping I drop the mic
And have a stare down and jump in the crowd and start scrapping
Kuniving Kon Artis my nigga we get it cracking
While the paramedics pick you up we on the side laughing

(Chorus: Kon Artis) (x2)
(Shit can happen)
This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
(Shit can happeeen)
Shit can happen to him and your ass
(Shit can happen)
You can be touched don't think you can't
(Shit can happeeen)
Cuz niggas ain't fucking around no more man

(Swifty)
The feds can't hold me (why?)
I hold feds
I was born with a dark ass cloud over my head (uh huh)
Raining acid (nigga)
You can't refrain from getting your ass kicked
Cuz you talk too much
You asked for it
I'm on some massive shit
Everybody ignore me
They wouldn't fuck with me if I was performing at an orgy
These niggas think I'm fronting (what up now?)
Then they change stories
I catch you and they thinking everything's hunky dory
I even have you pour me the gasoline for me (do it)
Pulling up slowly
Cop tailing your homies
Met a lot of niggas but you wouldn't wanna know me (for real)
Your ass might not even make it home with your roley (nigga)
Don't even try
In your system like eco lie
Trying to beef with me
Nigga please, your people die
I'm so wicked that my momma gave birth illegally (uh huh)
I survived the abortion immediately (Surprise!!!)

(Eminem)
Picture me sitting in a jail cell rotting
Or barricaded in a motel with twelve shotguns
When the *cops* come knocking
Each hands got one
Cocked ready to dump slugs heavy as shot puts
One man army
Guns can't harm me
Young and ornery
Worse than my Uncle Ronnie
Ever since I got my first gun pulled on me
I can't stop airing out my dirty laundry
Middle fingers flip at censorship
Your friends just flipped
Over this swift penmanship
Ever since I spit some shit on Infinite
I been giving it a hundred and ten percent
Cuz when I vent most of my energy's
Spent on enemies
Eighty percent of what I invent is hennessy
And twenty percent is from being hungry as sin
Ten is because I love being under your skin
Ya, (shit) shit can happen
So stick to rapping
Quit the yapping
Or I'ma lift the mac in
That can lead to another mishap happening
Skip the crap
Get the can of whoop ass cracking

Chorus (x2)

(Outro: Eminem)
(Shit can happen)
It can and it will
(Shit can happeeen)
Fuck around with Amityville
(Shit can happen)
And you die
Insanity still
(Shit can happeeen)
Mentality of twelve motherfuckers in six different bodies
(Shit can happen)
With their personality split
(Shit can happeeen)
Fucking you up with hit after hit
(Shit can happen)
Sticking you up with clip after clip
(Shit can happeeen)
Making you suck dick after dick
(Shit can happen)
(Shit can happeeen)
Dirty motherfuckin dozen
(Shit can happen)
The Kon Artis
(Shit can happeeen)
Motherfuckin Peter S. Bizarre
Swifty McVeigh
The Kuniva
Dirty fatherfuckin Harry
Puttin you down in the cemetary
You get buried
All of you motherfuckers suck our motherfucking cock
We are not playing
We are not playing
We are not bullshitting
This is not a motherfucking joke
