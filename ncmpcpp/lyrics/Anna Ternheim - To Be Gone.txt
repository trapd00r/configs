Leave the body, leave the mind
Leave the body, leave the mind
Every promise every place behind

I just happend to feel so alone
for today for all days to come
I just wanna be wanna be gone
I just wanna be wanna be gone

Leave the quiet, leave the night
Leave the quiet, leave the night
Broken feelings of dreams out of sight

Pictures in your head at night
For tonight for all nights to come
Erased for good and always gone
Erased for good and always gone

Leave the city, leave the cold
Leave the city, leave the cold
Young people far to old

Let me cross a very fine line
for today for a lifetime
For today for a lifetime

Leave the body, leave the mind
Let me
Leave the body, leave the mind
Every promise every place behind

I just happend to feel so alone
for today for all days to come
for today for all days to come
I just wanna be wanna be gone
