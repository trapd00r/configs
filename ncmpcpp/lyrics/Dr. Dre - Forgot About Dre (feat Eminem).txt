Dr. Dre:
Y'all know me, still the same ol' G, but I been low-key
Hated on by most these niggas with no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys, no boats no snowmobiles and no skis
Mad at me 'cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries

Got a crib with a studio and it's all full o' tracks, to add to the wall full o' plaques 
Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze, ho please
You better bow down on both knees, who you think taught you to smoke trees

Who you think brought you the oldies, Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C.'s
The Snoop D-o-double-g's, and the group that said "motherfuck tha police"
Gave you a tape full dope beats to bump, when you stroll through in your 'hood
And when your albums sales wasn't doin' too good, who's the doctor they told you to go see

Y'all better listen up closely, all you niggas that said that I'd turned pop
Or The Firm flopped, y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep
So fuck y'all, all o' y'all, if y'all don't like me, blow me
Y'all gon' keep fuckin' around wit' me, and turn me back to the old me

Eminem:
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got some'in to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips, just a bunch o' gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got some'in to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips, just a bunch o' gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

So what do you say to somebody you hate (What)
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way (Yup)
Just study a tape of N.W.A

One day I was walkin' by, with a Walkman on, when I caught a guy 
Give me an awkward eye, (What you lookin' at) strangled him up in the parkin' lot with his Karl Kani's
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not, I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck, right next to a humongous truck in a two car garage

Hoppin' out with two broken legs, tryna walk it off, fuck you too bitch call the cops
I'm 'a kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through, me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches, and still weren't found out (Right here)

So from here on out, it's The Chronic 2, startin' today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew (Chikka-chikka-chikka)

Slim Shady, hotter than a set o' twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up, when the temp goes up to the mid-eighties
Callin' men ladies, sorry Doc but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me, it's OK go with him Hailey (Dada)

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got some'in to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips, just a bunch o' gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got some'in to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips, just a bunch o' gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

Dr. Dre:
If it was up to me, you motherfuckers would stop comin' up to me wit' yo' hands out, lookin' up to me
Like you want somethin' free, when my last CD was out, you wasn't bumpin' me
But now that I gots lil' company, everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me, 'cause I'm from the streets of (C—C—Compton, Compton)

I told 'em all, all them lil' gangsters who you think help mold 'em all
Now you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like I ain't got none, what you think I sold 'em all
'Cause I stay well off, now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' "Dre fell off"
What, 'cause I been in the lab, with a pen an' a pad tryna get this damn label off

I ain't havin' that, this is the millennium of Aftermath and ain't gon' be nothin' after that
So gimme one more platinum plaque and fuck rap, you can have it back
So where's all the mad rappers at, it's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats know that I was strapped with Gat's, when you were cuddlin' a Cabbage Patch
