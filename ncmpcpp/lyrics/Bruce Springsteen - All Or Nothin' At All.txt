Said you'd give me just a little kiss
And you'd rock me for a little while
Well you'd slip me just a piece of it
Listen up little child
I Want it all or nothin' at all
I Want it all or nothin' at all

Said you'd take me for a little dance
If you had a little time on your hands
Well all I do is push and shove
Just to get a little piece of your love
I want it all or nothin' at all
I want it all or nothin' at all

Well now I don't wanna be greedy
But when it comes to love there ain't no doubt
You just ain't gonna get what you want
With one foot in bed and one foot out
You got to give it all or nothin' at all
All or nothin' at all

Now I only got a little time
So if you're gonna change your mind
Then shout out what you're thinkin' of
If what you're thinkin' of is love
I want it all or nothin' at all
I want it all or nothin' at all
I want to have it all or nothin' at all
I want it all or nothin' at all
I want it all or nothin' at all
