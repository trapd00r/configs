One more night
To bear this nightmare
What more do I have to say

Crying for me 
Was never worth a tear
My lonely soul is only filled with fear

Long hours of loneliness
Between me and the sea

Losing emotion
Finding devotion
Should I dress in white and search the sea
As I always wish to be 
One with the waves
Ocean soul

Walking the tide line
I hear your name
As angels whisper it
Something so beautiful it hurts

Long hours of loneliness
Between me and the sea

I only wished 
To become something beautiful
Through my music, through my silent devotion

Losing emotion
Finding devotion
Should I dress in white and search the sea
As I always wish to be 
One with the waves
Ocean soul

Losing emotion
Finding devotion
Should I dress in white and search the sea
As I always wish to be 
One with the waves
Ocean soul
