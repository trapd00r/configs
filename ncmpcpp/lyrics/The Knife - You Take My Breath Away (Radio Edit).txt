We are the people who's come here to play
I don't like it easy
I don't like the straight way
We're in the middle of something
We're here to stay
And we raise our heads for the colour red

I'm in the first row on your show, in the first row
on the First Floor Power show
Your vibrato's like vulnerable leaves,
You do it crazy, that's how you talk to me

We are the people who's come here to play
I don't like it easy
I don't like the straight way
We're in the middle of something
We're here to stay
And we raise our heads for the colour red

I heard you for the first time on the radio
When I was going somewhere in a car
You touched my heart, like a knife that's very sharp
Or like a bird (I was thinking about birds), you just set free
That's just like me(I keep my knife sharp), when I hear you speak

We are the people who's come here to play
I don't like it easy
I don't like the straight way
We're in the middle of something
We're here to stay
And we raise our heads for the colour red

I like vanilla and I like sex
I ride the pony that I like best
I knew that there was something I missed
I was fifteen when I first got kissed,
Before I knew about the equality way
I wanted to get laid to "Take My Breath Away"

We are the people who's come here to play
I don't like it easy
I don't like the straight way
We're in the middle of something
We're here to stay
And we raise our heads for the colour red

We are the people who's come here to play
I don't like it easy
I don't like the straight way
We're in the middle of something
We're here to stay
And we raise our heads for the colour red
