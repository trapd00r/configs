I stand in the distance, I view from afar
Should I offer some assistance
Should it matter who you are
We all get hurt by love, and we all have our cross to bear
But in the name of understanding, now
Our problems should be shared
Confide in me, confide in me

I can keep a secret and throw away the key
But sometimes to release it is to set our children free
We all get hurt by love, and we all have our cross to bear
But in the name of understanding now
Our problems should be shared
Confide in me, confide in me
(Confide in me, confide in me)
(Confide in me, confide in me)
Confide in me
(Confide in me, confide in me)
Confide in me

Stick or twist, the choice is yours
Hit or miss, what's mine is yours
Stick or twist, the choice is yours
Hit or miss, what's mine is yours

We all get hurt by love, and we all have our cross to bear
But in the name of understanding now
Our problems should be shared
Confide in me, confide in me
Confide in me, confide in me

(Confide in me, confide in me)
(Confide in me, confide in me)
Confide in me
(Confide in me, confide in me)
(Confide in me, confide in me)
Confide in me

(Repeat)
