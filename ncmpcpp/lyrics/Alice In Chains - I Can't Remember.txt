Turn around you say
'Scuse the 'tude but I haven't eaten today
And my eyes are turning grey
What's your name?

(CHORUS)
I can't remember...I can't remember

Bring me down you try
Feel the pain and keep it all in till you die
Without eyes you cannot cry
Who's to blame?

(CHORUS)

Remember identity, the visions in my mind from
Screamin' at me
And mama, mama, ooh...my angry brains of infancy

Knocked down but I have enough hate
to breathe, down your throat and steal your energy
You took everyting but my will to be
Now the loss of your god won't make me bleed

I am alive
