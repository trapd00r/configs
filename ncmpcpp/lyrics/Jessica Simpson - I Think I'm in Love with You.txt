Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah..
Yeah yeah Ohhhhh

Everytime you're near baby
I get kinda crazy in my head for you
I don't know what to do
And baby
I get kinda shaky when they mention you
I just lose my cool

My friends tell me
Something has come over me
And I think I know what it is

I think I'm in love

Boy I think that I'm in love with you
Got me doing silly things when it comes to you
In love, boy I think that I'm in love with you
Got me telling all my friends what I feel for you

Just the other night baby, I saw you hangin
You were with your crew
I was with mine too
You took me by surprise
When you turned and looked me in the eyes
Oh, you really blew my mind

I don't know what's gotten into me
But, I kinda think I know what it is

I think I'm in love

Boy I think that I'm in love with you
Got me doing silly things when it comes to you
I'm in love, boy I think that I'm in love with you
Got me telling all my friends what I feel for you

Boy I think that I'm in love with you
Got me been telling all my friends what I feel for you

Something strange has come over me
Got me going out of my mind
Never met a guy like you before
You make me feel special inside

I think I'm in love

Boy I think that I'm in love with you
Got me doing silly things when it comes to you
Boy I think that I'm in love with you
Got me telling all my friends what I feel for you

Boy I think that I'm in love with you
Got me doing silly things when it comes to you
Boy I think that I'm in love with you
Got me telling all my friends what I feel for you

Boy I think that I'm in love with you
Got me doing silly things when it comes to you
Boy I think that I'm in love with you
Got me telling all my friends what I feel for you
