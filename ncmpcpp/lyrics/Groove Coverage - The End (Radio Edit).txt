My home is in motion, as darkness unfolds
The air overloaded, the sky's dancing gold
But you went away, you left me to stay
We'll see us in Heaven, I'm counting the days

At the end of time, at the end of us
At the end of everything we had
Only faith helps you, only grace can do
Only you can take the pain
'Cause the end of peace is the end of life
And the end of any happiness
Only love helps you, only trust can do
Only you can take the pain of me

When thunder is calling, I feel so alive
The very first morning, can you see the light?
But you closed the door, to what I adored
We'll see us in Heaven, I'm counting no more

At the end of time, at the end of us
At the end of everything we had
Only faith helps you, only grace can do
Only you can take the pain
'Cause the end of peace is the end of life
And the end of any happiness
Only love helps you, only trust can do
Only you can take the pain of me
