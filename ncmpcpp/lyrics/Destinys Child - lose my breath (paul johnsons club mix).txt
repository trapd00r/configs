Hit me!

Can you keep up? 
Babyboy, make me lose my breath 
bring the noise, make me lose my breath 
hit me hard, make me lose my *pant pant* 
Can you keep up? 
Babyboy, make me lose my breath 
bring the noise, make me lose my breath 
hit me hard, make me lose my breath 

Ooh...
I put it right there, made it easy for you to get to 
now you wanna act like you don't know what to do 
after I done done everything that you asked me 
grabbed you, grind you, liked you, tried you 
moved so fast, baby now i can't find you 
Ooh...
I'm startin' to believe that I'm way too much for you 
all that talk but it seems like you can't come through 
all them lines like you could satisfy me 
now I see where believing you got me 
gave you the wheel but you can't drive me 

Can you keep up? 
Babyboy, make me lose my breath 
bring the noise, make me lose my breath 
hit me hard, make me lose my *pant pant* 
Can you keep up? 
Babyboy, make me lose my breath 
bring the noise, make me lose my breath 
hit me hard, make me lose my breath 

Ooh... 
Two things i don't like when i'm trynna get my groove 
is a partner that meets me only halfway, and just can't prove 
Take me out so deep when you know you can't swim 
need a lifegaurd and I need protection 
to put it on me deep in the right direction 
Ooh... 
You understand the facts that I'm trynna get to you 
You movin' so slow like you just don't have a clue 
Didn't momma teach you to give affection 
learn the difference from a man and an adolescent 
It ain't you boo, so get ta steppin' 

Can you keep up? 
Babyboy, make me lose my breath 
bring the noise, make me lose my breath 
hit me hard, make me lose my *pant pant* 
Can you keep up? 
Babyboy, make me lose my breath 
bring the noise, make me lose my breath 
hit me hard, make me lose my breath 
Can you keep up? 
Babyboy, make me lose my breath 
bring the noise, make me lose my breath 
hit me hard, make me lose my *pant pant* 
Can you keep up? 
Babyboy, make me lose my breath 
bring the noise, make me lose my breath 
hit me hard, make me lose my breath 

If you can't make me say oooh 
Like the beat of this drum 
Why you ask for some 
You ain't really want none 
If you can't make me say ooh 
Like the beat of this groove 
You don't have no business in this 
Here's your papers, baby you are dismissed 

Can you keep up? 
Babyboy, make me lose my breath 
bring the noise, make me lose my breath 
hit me hard, make me lose my *pant pant* 
Can you keep up? 
Babyboy, make me lose my breath 
bring the noise, make me lose my breath 
hit me hard, make me lose my breath
