Me donkey want water, hold'em Joe,
Spring 'round the corner, hold'em Joe
Me donkey want water, hold'em Joe
Everybody want water, hold'em Joe
Fuma la catchimba, hold'em Joe

We on a journey he don't walk straight
And that is because he's so underweight
Donkey of mine he don't like weight
Put him on a cart he never walk straight

Spring 'round the corner, hold'em Joe
Me donkey want water, hold'em Joe
Everybody want water, hold'em Joe
Fuma la catchimba, hold'em Joe

My ole donkey went courtin' one day
With a donkey named Melda across the way
She was twice his age, he put up a fight
Now he's cryin' every night
Oh lemme go, darling Melda,
You breaking my back bone
Lemme go, darling Melda,
You breaking my back

Some people say that my donkey is bad
an' that is because he's from Trinidad
Donkey of mine he won't work at all
All he want to do is break out him stall
