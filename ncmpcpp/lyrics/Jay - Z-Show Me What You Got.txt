[Intro]
This is State Of Emergency
What you want me to do? Im sorry!
I'm back..hehehe
UH, huh uh, lets go get 'em Just

[Chorus]
HEY HEY HEY HEY HEY HEY
Show me what you got, lil mama
Show me what you got, pretty lady
Show me what you got, shorty
Show me what you got, baby
Hands up and.. waves, waves, waves, waves

[Verse 1]
Give the drummer some
I already gave the summer some
It's the winter's turn
Hovie Hov is the coldest, I'm just getting better with time
I'm like Opus One
Young, no two alike like a snowflake
OK! Show me what you got baby
Words is slurring engine purring
Mami frontin but I'm so determined
Shots of Patron, now she's in the zone
I ain't talking about the two-trhee
Mami in the zone like the homie 2-3
Jordan or James, makes no difference
Boo I'm ballin the same
I am the Mike Jordan of recording
You might want to fallback from recording
But you right it's not important
So it forced him to go for the hype
For being brave and may applaud him
Well misery I will assure them
Oh baby just ignore them
Truth or dare mami listen and learn
I got a drop I just took off the top, it's your turn

[Chorus 2X]

[Verse 2]
H.O.V.A., gold bottles of that ace of spade
Why even fool with these other guys, they all stingy
All these dudes know how to say is gimme
Gimme some ass, gimme some brain
Gimme your number, gimme your name
But if I get one night baby girl I swear
I'll make you tell these other dudes gimme got you here
I'll take you shopping, take long trips
I'll take the cork off, you can take sips
I'll take you there, take my time
Take you clothes off, I'll take off mine
Ma, show me what you got
Hovie in the spot tried to told you I was hot
Tell these other dudes it's a wrap
Get the fuck out the throne you clone, the King's back!
Y'all got less than 2 months to get y'all thing together
Good luck!

[Chorus 2X]

Ladies and gentlemen the most incredible!
H-O, uh huh
H-O, uh huh
Is back!
Justin Blaze
You Blaze that
Roc-A-Fella Records
Dynasty continues, y'all die
Uh Huh, peace!
