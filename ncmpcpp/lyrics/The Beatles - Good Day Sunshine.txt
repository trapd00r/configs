Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine

I need to laugh
And when the sun is out
I've got something I can laugh about
I feel good
In a special way
I'm in love and it's a sunny day

Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine

We take a walk
The sun is shining down
Burns my feet as they touch the ground

Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine

Then we lie
Beneath the shady tree
I love her and she's loving me
She feels good (she does)
She knows she's looking fine
I'm so proud to know that she is mine

Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
(Good day, sunshine)
(Good day, sunshine)
(Good day, sunshine)
(Good day)
