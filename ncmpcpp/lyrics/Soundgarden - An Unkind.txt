We see the vipers of distance
Crawl into our lives everyday
Breeding our Eden's of hatred
Pathetically stupid and unkind
We couldn't look a saint in the eye
We couldn't look a saint in the eye

On the storm
It's time to go
On the storm
It's time to go

Marching in lines of contradiction
Forgetting the history we make
Loving our hangmen as the penultimate joke
We lack the Moses to look
A saint in the eye

On the storm
It's time to go
On the storm
It's time to go

On the storm
It's time to go
On the storm
It's time to go
