You could buy me diamonds
You could buy me pearls
Take me on a cruise around the world
Baby, you know I'm worth it

Dinner lit by candles
Run my bubble bath
Make love tenderly to last and last
Baby, you know I'm worth it

Wanna please
Wanna keep
Wanna treat your woman right

Not just told
But it's showed
That you know she is worth your time

You will lose
If you choose
To refuse
To put her first

She will
and she can
Find a man who knows her worth
mmmmmmmmmm hmm
Cuz a real man knows a real woman when he sees her
And a real woman knows a real man ain't 'fraid to please her(yer yer)
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first(comes first)
And a real man just can't deny
A woman's worth
hmm mmm hmmm mmm hmmm mmm hmmm hmm mmm hmm 
hmmm hmmm mhmmmmmmmm

If you treat me fairly 
I'll give you all my goods
Treat you like a real woman should
Baby, I know you're worth it

If you never play me
Promise not to bluff
I'll hold you down when shit gets rough
Cuz baby, I know you're worth it

She walks the mile
Makes you smile
All the while
Bein' true

Don't take for granted
The passions that she has for you

You will lose
If you choose
To refuse
To put her first

She will
and she can
Find a man who knows her worth

Oooooh

Cuz a real man knows a real woman when he sees her
And a real woman knows a real man ain't 'fraid to please her
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first(first baby)
And a real man just can't deny
A woman's worth

No need to read between the lines spelled out for you(spelled out for you)
Just hear this song cuz you can't go wrong when you value(you value)
A woman's (woman's, woman's, woman's) worth

Cuz a real man knows a real woman when he sees her
And a real woman knows a real man ain't fraid to please her
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first
And a real man just can't deny
A woman's worth

Cuz a real man knows a real woman when he sees her
And a real woman knows a real man ain't 'fraid to please her
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first
And a real man just can't deny
A woman's worth
