[Young Buck]
Let me go and show you niggaz what my whip game like
I whip it to the left, and whip it to the right
I mix it with the Sprite, and flip it with the whites
See I make my own price cause I take my own flights
I still got my ski mask, STILL need cash
STILL got them eighteens as if you want a half
That's 11-5 apiece dawg if ya do the math
But I do it for the ten for my niggaz in the cab
Got a bitch in Decatur, she shake it for the paper
So when I make it rain, I just get it back later
See cuz over there, he'll kill ya ass for nuttin (I got ya homie!)
6-1-5, Ca$hville, we buckin
