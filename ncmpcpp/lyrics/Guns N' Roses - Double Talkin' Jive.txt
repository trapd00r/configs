Found a head and an arm in da garbage can
Don't know why I'm here
Livin' on the run for oh so long
I gotta go collect
Double talkin' jive
Get the money motherfucker
'Cause I got no more patience
Double talkin'
-I got (lies)-
No more patience man

Back in town an'a all new friends
They sayin' how ya been?
Fucked up and outta place
That's how I felt back then
Double talkin' jive
Get the money motherfucker
'Cause I got no more patience
Double talkin'
-I got (lies)-
No more patience man
You dig what I'm sayin'?!
