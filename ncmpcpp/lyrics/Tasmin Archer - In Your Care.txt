The light is fading from my room
As night time comes around too soon
I'm so afraid.
Swollen eyes portray my pain
As tears fall like the summer rain
I'm so alone

Son of a bitch you broke my heart
I need a little loving
To take away the pain
How could you let me down
When I'm in your care.

I pull the covers to myself
Drink and smoke upon his breath
I close my eyes.
Again i pray to God above
What have i done to lose his love?
Am i to blame?

Son of a bitch you broke my heart
I need a little loving
To take away the pain
How could you let me down
When I'm in your care?

When i am dreaming
I can call out
No one hears 
Father
I am falling
From your heart in tears

Son of a bitch you broke my heart
I need a little loving
To take away the pain
How could you let me down
When I'm in your care.

Hush little baby don't you cry
Daddys gunna sing you a lullaby
To show he cares.
But you must keep our secret safe
Is this love or is this hate?
I feel so scared.

Son of a bitch you broke my heart
I need a little loving
To take away the pain
How could you let me down
When I'm in your care?
