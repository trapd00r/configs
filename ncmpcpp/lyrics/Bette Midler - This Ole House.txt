This ole house once knew my children.
This ole house once knew my life.
This ole house was home and comfort
as we lived through storm and strife.
This ole house once rang with laughter.
This ole house heard many shouts.
Now she trembles in the darkness
when the lightning walks about.

Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer.
Ain't a-gonna need this house no more.
Ain't got time to fix the shingles.
Ain't got time to fix the floor.
Ain't got time to oil the hinges,
nor to mend the window panes.
Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer.
I'm a-gettin' ready to meet the saints.

This ole house is gettin' shaky.
This ole house is gettin' old.
This ole house lets in the rain.
This ole house lets in the cold.
On my knees I'm gettin' shaky,
but I feel no fear or pain,
'cause I see an angel peekin'
through a broken window pane.

I ain't a-gonna need this house no longer.
Ain't a-gonna need this house no more.
Ain't got time to fix the shingles.
Ain't got time to fix the floor.
I ain't got time to oil the hinges,
nor to mend the window panes.
Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer.
I'm a-gettin' ready to meet the saints.

This ole house is afraid of thunder.
This ole house is afraid of storms.
This ole house just groans and trembles
when the night wind flings its arms.
This ole house is gettin' feeble.
This old house is needin' paint.
Just like me it's tuckered out,
but I'm a-gettin' ready to meet the saints.

Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer.
Ain't a-gonna need this house no more.
Ain't got time to fix the shingles.
Ain't got time to fix the floor.
I ain't got time to oil the hinges,
nor to mend the window panes.
Ain't gonna need this house no longer.
I'm a-gettin' ready to meet the saints.
I'm gettin' ready to meet the saints.
