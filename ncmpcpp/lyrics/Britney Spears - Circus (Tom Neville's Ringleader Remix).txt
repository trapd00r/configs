There?s only two types of people in the world 
The ones that entertain, and the ones that observe 
Well baby I?m a put-on-a-show kinda girl 
Don?t like the backseat, gotta be first 
I?m like the ringleader 
I call the shots 
I?m like a firecracker 
I make it hot 
When I put on a show.... 

I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins 
Spotlight on me and I?m ready to break 
I?m like a performer, the dancefloor is my stage 
Better be ready, hope that ya feel the same 

All eyes on me in the center of the ring 
Just like a circus 
When I crack that whip, everybody gon' trip 
Just like a circus 
Don?t stand there watching me, follow me 
Show me what you can do 
Everybody let go, we can make a dancefloor 
Just like a circus 

There?s only two types of guys out there, 
Ones that can hang with me, and ones that are scared 
So baby I hope that you came prepared 
I run a tight shift so, beware 
I?m like the ringleader 
I call the shots 
I?m like a firecracker 
I make it hot 
Then I put on a show 

I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins 
Spotlight on me and I?m ready to break 
I?m like a performer, the dancefloor is my stage 

Better be ready, hope that ya feel the same 

All eyes on me in the center of the ring 
Just like a circus 
When I crack that whip, everybody gon' trip 
Just like a circus 
Don?t stand there watching me, follow me 
Show me what you can do 
Everybody let go, we can make a dancefloor 
Just like a circus
