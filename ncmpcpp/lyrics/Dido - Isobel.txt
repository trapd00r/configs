I thought it was funny when you, missed the train
When I rang you at home, they said you'd left, yesterday
I thought it was strange when your, car was found
By the tree in Ennis where we used to hang around

Dear Isobel, I hope you're well, and what you've done is right,
Oh it's been such hell, I wish you well, I hope you're safe tonight
It's been a long day coming and long will it last
When it's last day leaving, and I'm helping it pass
By loving you more

And who would he become, all the things he'd have done
Would he have loved you, and not let you down?
And would he be stronger than his father?
Don't punish yourself; leave it well alone

Dear Isobel, I hope you're well, and what you've done is right,
Oh it's been such hell, I wish you well, I hope you're safe tonight
It's been a long day coming and long will it last
When it's last day leaving, and I'm helping it pass
By loving you more
