Boy, you got me stranded
Feeling for you
And I don't know what to do about it
'Cos you got me stranded
Come on and help me through
Boy, you got me stranded with you

Such a beautiful mind
Such a beautiful soul
I've never met someone like you before
And we could fly so high

Painted pictures of you and me together
Coming true in my mind
And I feel, oh baby
Deep down inside
We could be magical

Boy, you got me stranded
Feeling for you
And I don't know what to do about it
'Cos you got me stranded
Come on and help me through
Boy, you got me stranded with you

Now I've opened my heart
I'm sharing secrets with you, oh
I'm not afraid
Baby, just take my hand
And this time oh yea

And lead us to a place where we can find eachother
And trustin' peacefully
And all I know is that I'm lost in your love
That's one thing, one thing I know for sure

Boy, you got me stranded
Feeling for you
And I don't know what to do about it
'Cos you got me stranded
Come on and help me through
Boy, you got me stranded with you

I never thought I'd fall so easily
By simply lookin' in your eyes
But boy you got me
Boy, you got me stranded
Wont you come and rescue me
Wont you come and rescue me

Boy, you got me stranded
Feeling for you
And I don't know what to do about it
'Cos you got me stranded
Come on and help me through
Boy, you got me stranded with you
