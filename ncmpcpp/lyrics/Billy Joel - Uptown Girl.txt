Oh, oh

Uptown girl
She's been living in her uptown world
I bet she never had a backstreet guy
I bet her mama never told her why

I'm gonna try for an uptown girl
She's been living in her white bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man
That's what I am

And when she knows what she wants from her time
And when she wakes up and makes up her mind
She'll see I'm not so tough
Just because I'm in love

With an uptown girl
You know I've seen her in her uptown world
She's getting tired of her high class toys
And all the presents from her uptown boys
She's got a choice

Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa
Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa

Uptown girl
You know I can't afford to buy her pearls
But maybe someday when my ship comes in
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been
And then I'll win

And when she's walking, she's looking so fine
And when she's talking, she'll say that she's mine
She'll say I'm not so tough
Just because I'm in love

With an uptown girl
She's been living in her white bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man
That's what I am

Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa
Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa

Uptown girl
She's my uptown girl
Don't you know I'm in love
With an uptown girl
My uptown girl
Don't you know I'm in love 
With an uptown girl
My uptown girl
Don't you know I'm in love
With an uptown girl
My uptown girl
Don't you know I'm in love
With an uptown girl
My uptown girl
