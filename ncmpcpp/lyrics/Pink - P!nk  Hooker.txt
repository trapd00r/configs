[Chorus 2x]
And you ain't nothin' but a hooker
Sellin' your fuckin' soul

Back up! They want you, I swear
You got no worries, you got no cares
All you got is motherfuckers who will jock you
Yeah, you got money in your pocket
And you shoot up the ground like a rocket
You move so fast, lord you can't stop it
There you are in the club swingin'
And I'm just standin' there, standin' there laughin'
All the things people have you believin'
I feel sorry for your ass is out of season
Maybe you should think of cuttin' down drinkin'
Cause you look like a fat rat sinkin'
I coulda helped you, but you had to act out
You don't have a fuckin' clue what I'm about

[Chorus 2x]
And you ain't nothin' but a hooker
Sellin' your fuckin' soul

I saw it comin' through the line like a full back
You're a crack slack, a fuckin' rap back (yeah)
Don't react, you're not fact
Don't give a fuck, yes, like that
What you gonna do now that you ain't got nothin'
Look around honey, you been frontin'
Everybody knows that you're a fraud! (And I'm making records!)
My salutations, no hesitations
No reservation, just cancellation
And if I blow it then I blow it
Cause I'm a poet and I know it

[Chorus 2x]
And you ain't nothin' but a hooker
Sellin' your fuckin' soul

[Repeat until fade]
You wanna try me
Don't you know-
