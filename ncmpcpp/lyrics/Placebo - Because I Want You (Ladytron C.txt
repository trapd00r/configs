Fall into you, is all I seem to do
When I hit the bottle
'Cause I'm afraid to be alone

Tear us in two, is all it seems to do
As the anger fades
This house is no longer a home

Don't give up on the dream
Don't give up on the wanting
And everything that's true
Don't give up on the dream
Don't give up on the wanting

Because I want you too
Because I want you too
Because I want you too
Because I want you
Because I want you

Stumble into you, is all I ever do
My memory's hazy
And I'm afraid to be alone

Tear us in two, is all it's gonna do
As the headache fades
This house is no longer a home

Don't give up on the dream
Don't give up on the wanting
And everything that's true
Don't give up on the dream
Don't give up on the wanting

Because I want you too
Because I want you too
Because I want you too
Because I want you
Because I want you

Because I want you too
Because I want you too
Because I want you too
Because I want you
Because I want you

Fall into you is all I ever do!
When I hit the bottle
'Cause I'm afraid to be alone

Tear us in two
Tear us in two
Tear us in two

Because I want you too
Because I want you too
Because I want you
Because I want you
Because I want you too
Because I want you too
Because I want you
Because I want you
