I can count it on my fingers
I've got all my reasons not to feel
I'm numb as rigor mortis
Scared by monkey faces
Drowned in shark fins


But I don't feel like feeling
Feeling like you


Now I'm in the mirror
Now it's getting clear
I fear that I'm in you
Now I'm into plastics
Now I've made a mask
It looks like fish heads


But I don't feel like feeling
Feeling like you


Face pollution
Face pollution
Face pollution
Face pollution
