Come on lift your head high reaching out for the sky 
Spread your wings out and fly 
Right through the starry night 
You're unique, you're o.k. Never must be afraid 
Spread your wings out and fly 
Right through the starry night. 
Through the starry night. (2x) 

Move as I groove on. Now put your dancing shoes on. 
It's time to realize you can rise to the top. 
Now don't you ever stop. 
Sometimes in live when you feel like giving up. 
You got to keep your head up. Be the best you can. 
Strive in your live to make a masterplan. 
Here I am, here I am bam. 
Positive vibes for the mind so slam. 
All the negativity around you and me. 
Feel free mentally. Break the chain holding you down. 
To the ground turn up the sound. 
Here it is if you wanna try. 
Keep your head up and reach for the sky. 

Feel the vibe moving your mind. 
Feel the vibe always on time. 
Elevate you got what it takes. Elevate it's not too late. 
I got the remedy just follow me. 
Fly high with no XTC. It's real and natural. 
You feel good like I know you would. 
Knock, knock, knock. Who is it. 
R.O.C.K. the lyrical wizard. Get ready to fly with me. 
To a place with mysteries. 
Close your eyes, let yourself go. 
Don't be afraid cause you got to know. 
Here it is you wanna try. 
Keep your head up and reach for the sky
