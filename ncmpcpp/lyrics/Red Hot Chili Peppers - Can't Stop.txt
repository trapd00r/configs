Send "Can't Stop" Ringtone to your Cell Can't stop, addicted to the shin dig
Chop top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation.
Defunct the pistol that you pay for
This punk the feeling that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
Eastside love is living on the west-end.
Knock out but boy you better come to
Don't die you know the truth as some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burning so bright, I wonder what the wave meant?
White heat is screaming in the jungle
Complete the motion if you stumble
Go ask the dust for any answers
Come back strong with 50 belly dancers!

The world I love,
The tears I drop,
To be part of
The wave, Can't Stop.
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love,
The trains I hop,
To be part of
The wave, Can't Stop.
Come and tell me when it's time to.

Sweetheart is bleeding in the snowcone
So smart, she's leading me to ozone
Music: The great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature.
I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation:
Worth your weight, the gold of meditation.
This chapter's going to be a close one
Smoke rings, I know you're going to blow one
All on a spaceship, persevering
Use my hands for everything but steering.
Can't stop the spirits when they need you
Mop tops are happy when they feed you
J. Butterfly is in the treetop
Birds that blow the meaning into be-bop.

The world I love,
The tears I drop,
To be part of
The wave, Can't Stop.
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love,
The trains I hop,
To be part of
The wave, Can't Stop.
Come and tell me when it's time to.

Wait a minute, I'm passing out, win or lose
Just like you.
Far more shocking than anything I ever knew
How 'bout you?
10 more reasons why I need somebody new
Just like you.
Far more shocking than anything I ever knew
Right on cue.

Can't stop, addicted to the shin dig
Chop top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation.
Defunct the pistol that you pay for
This punk the feeling that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
Eastside love is living on the west-end.
Knock out but boy you better come to
Don't die you know the truth as some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burning so bright, I wonder what the wave meant?
Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk, but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the Gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering.
Your image in the dictionary.
This life is more than ordinary.
Can I get 2, maybe even 3 of these?
Come from space,
To teach you of the pleiades.

Can't stop the spirits when they need you.

This life is more than just a read-through.
