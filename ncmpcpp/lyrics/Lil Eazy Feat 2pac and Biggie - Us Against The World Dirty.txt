feat. Big B)

[Big B]
Raisin' hustlas thieves and prostitutes
Young homie think before you shoot
Murderer

[Hook]
It's a crazy mixed up world
It's the end of the world
It's a crazy mixed up world
'Cause it's the end of the world [x2] [Bizzy Bone]
And trouble may come and sometimes
You'll get pulled over by one time
And when the 1999 rewinds
Didn't even make any strides
Murder all around the whole world it's nauseatin'
Everybody's hatin' everybody over rated
While everybody actin' agitated
I thought we graduated back in the sattle waitin'
Aboard the battle stations
Hation is a birth defect
And you know ain't nobody perfect
And when the curtains close
Open up the doors
No more

[Big B]
See we're losin' this world we love
And it looks like the sinnin' won't end
So I'm reachin' high up above
Lord let your blessins begin
And let's change the world

[Hook]
It's a crazy mixed up world
It's the end of the world
It's a crazy mixed up world
'Cause it's the end of the world [x2]

[Flesh-N-Bone]
And got me ready to set off the riot
Ridin' with my Trues Humbly United Gathering Souls
Here we go roll up some more Phillies
My nigga let me hit it
Niggas be thuggin' immortalized let's get high
It's the niggas you most desire
I can remember from way back in the day
Comin' up out the ghetto was a hell of a struggle
From sellin' the fiends llello
But it was my dream to kick flows
To put my people on another level
Now could it be for the lust
Or Could it be for the rush
My niggas love when they bust
Because they buck and you duck
They put your dick in the dust
My niggas Creepin' On Ah Come Up
Black Nigga Killa
Thuggish Ruggish nigga
Nigga fin to descend into a dawn of a new millenium
Anticipatin' life without Satan
Hatin' on all my enemies to hell I send y'all

[Hook]
It's a crazy mixed up world
It's the end of the world
It's a crazy mixed up world
'Cause it's the end of the world [x2]

[Layzie Bone]
Everyday the devil at me
And I wish the lord would throw a Hummer at me
I ain't happy
Me and Eazy-E in the B-E-N-Z
With my niggas right next to me it's my legacy
We can't let it stop us uh uh not now
The whole world endin' up in buck buck pow
Corruption destruction disaster
Everybody tryin' to rap faster than the master
Oh lord could you save my soul
Nigga tryin' to go platinum around forty years old
The lord knows we can do this shit
And ain't no stoppin' us know 'cause we can prove this shit
Nigga me Stew D PD Freaky G
The whole world wanna be a rappin' with me
I'm in the flesh
Let's talk about sex
Babies havin' babies generation-x
With the AIDS epidemic we ain't pure no more
And I know they gotta kill for the xxxx we ain't ready
First we lost Eazy then we lost Pac
Biggie got killed when the xxxx gon' stop
Everybody wanna know what's goin' on
With the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
Tryin' to be prepared for the Y2K
And if I don't die today
I'm tryin' to change the world

[Hook]
It's a crazy mixed up world
It's the end of the world
It's a crazy mixed up world
'Cause it's the end of the world [x2]

[Wish Bone]
You need a lesson you can learn from rappin'
But they tried to ban it realize it ain't gon' happen
We done changed the world
Ghetto voices bein' heard and fed
Now I got my guns better arm yourselves
Most don't have a clue
If it goes down what to do
Don't you know this government ain't proof for me and you
I have a dream no I have a wish
If we can't save ourselves then let's aid our kids
Let the world go wrong
Let these babies have somethin'
Let the world go wrong
Just don't blow this motherfucka up
You kill him he'll kill you
Some say it's stupid but violence really lives where I come from
Hungry little kids where I come from
Thugs like me where I come from

[Krayzie Bone]
Sometimes I sit and think about if I could change the world
Get in the mind of the nigga boys and girls
Show 'em that it is a better way
Satan got you trippin' don't listen to what the devil say
'Cause he can deceive ya
Play with your brain and mislead ya
But it won't be long
'Til the angels come
There's no where to hide but he'll run
Babylon the great has fallen
God is callin'
We all in y'all in
Souljahs go marchin' in bombin' 'em
But this time we ain't talkin'
We are tryin' to hit the target we launchin'
Police brutality got to cease
But I see the NYPD don't want peace
And the LAPD don't weant peace
So we'll never be free
So come on

We only got 'til the end of time (we got to the end of time)
To change the world (we shall overcome) change the world the world [x2]

[Hook]
It's a crazy mixed up world
It's the end of the world
It's a crazy mixed up world
'Cause it's the end of the world [x2]
