Is makin me see that you know what I need
Your breakin the rules cos you want it
There's so much - you can do - that will make me see that

Makin me love and adore you (baby)

Cos when you touch - me I just - can't believe that it's real

And make me believe that you'll always be trueO
You better not lie or deceive me

Ever been able to go

Well you started on my head
Better finish what you said to me now
(what you say, what you say)
