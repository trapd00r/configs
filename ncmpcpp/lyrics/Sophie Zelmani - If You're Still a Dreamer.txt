You don't know of the strings you're pulling
They've been hanging loose on me
I go crazy when I feel them moving cause' it reminds me I don't let you be free
I'll go through a fire for this
I'll go all the way and hope there's a loophole we've missed
My name can't live up to this matter So don't say it if you don't want what it will bring
And if you are scared of this dirty weather I think you should rush off for your thing
I'll be in the fire for you
My senses don't work so well when I'm hurt but I've said I love you
I'll be in the fire for you
I'll wait in the fire and I will hope I'm still there when you're through
