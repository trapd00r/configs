Send "Cripple's Crown" Ringtone to your Cell Unopened door
On the 13th floor
Conspiracy in the corridors

I'll take you down
Down to cripples crown

What should you say?
What can you do?
Satellites are watching you

I'll take you down
Down to cripples crown
I'll take you down
Down to cripples crown

At this dark hour
Who'll be there?

Open the door
If you dare
Venus fly trap on the stairs

I'll take you down
Down to cripples crown

There'll be no time
There'll be no tears
The elavator disappears

I'll take you down
Down to cripples crown
I'll take you down
Down to cripples crown

Cripples crown
Cripples crown
Cripples crown
Cripples crown
