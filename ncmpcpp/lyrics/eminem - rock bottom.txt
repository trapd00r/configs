Hey yo!
This song is dedicated to all the happy people
All the happy people, who have real nice lives
And have no idea whats it like, to be broke as fuck

I feel like I'm walking a tight rope without a circus net
Poppin' Percocet, I'm a nervous wreck
I deserve respect, but I work a sweat for this worthless check
'Bout to burst this tech at somebody to reverse this debt

Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
Full of venom and rage, especially when I'm engaged
And my daughter's down to her last diaper, it's got my ass hyper
I pray that God answers, maybe I'll ask nicer

Watchin' ballers while they flossin' in their Pathfinders
These overnight stars, becoming autograph signers
We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
Along with the small-fry's and average half-pinters

But player haters turnin' bitch like they have vagina's
'Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
Money will brainwash you and leave your ass mindless
Snakes slither in the grass spineless

That's rock bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom
When you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom
When you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear

That's rock bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom
When you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom
When you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear

My life is full of empty promises, and broken dreams
I'm hoping things look up, but there ain't no job openings
I feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished
Livin' in this house with no furnace, unfurnished

And I'm sick of working dead end jobs with lame pay
And I'm tired of being hired and fired the same day
But fuck it, if you know the rules to the game play
'Cause when we die, we know we all going the same way

'Cause it's cool to be the player, but it sucks to be the fan
When all you need is bucks to be the man
Plus a luxury sedan, comfortable and roomy in a six
But they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics

Who walk around depressed, and smoke a pound of cess a day
And yesterday went by so quick, it seems like it was just today
My daughter wants to throw the ball, but I'm too stressed to play
Live half my life and throw the rest away

That's rock bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom
When you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom
When you feel like you've had it up to here
Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear

That's rock bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom
When you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom
When you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear

There's people that love me and people that hate me
But it's the evil that made me this backstabbing, deceitful and shady
I want the money, the women, the fortune and fame
If it means I end up burning in hell, scorching in flames

If it means I'm stealing your checkbook and forging your name
This lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
'Cause right now I feel like just hit the rock bottom
I got problems, now everybody on my blocks got 'em

I'm screaming like them two cops, when 2Pac shot 'em
Holding two glocks, I hope your doors got new locks on 'em
My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or sock's on 'em
And them rings you wearin' look like they got a few rocks on 'em

And while you flaunt 'em, I could be takin' 'em to shops to pawn 'em
I got a couple of rings and a brand new watch, you want 'em
'Cause I never went gold off one song
I'm running up on someone's lawn with guns drawn

That's rock bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom
When you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom
When you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear

That's rock bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom
When you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom
When you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom
