50-50 chance
The doctor said
In the cardiac room
As she's lying in bed


There's a pan on the floor
Filled with something black
I need to know
I'm afraid to ask


I hug you
I hum to you
I've come to you
I touch you


I tell you
I love you
I sing to you
Bring to you
Anything


Her little heart
It beats so fast
Her body trembles
With the effort to last


I hug you
I hum to you
I've come to you
I touch you


I tell you
I love you
I sing to you
Bring to you
Anything


She's going home
Tomorrow at ten
The question is
Will she try it again?
