Why 
Why 
How many times do I have to try to tell you 
That I'm sorry for the things I've done 
But when I start to try to tell you 
That's when you have to tell me 
Hey... this kind of trouble's only just begun 
I tell myself too many times 
Why don't you ever learn to keep your big mouth shut 
That's why it hurts so bad to hear the words 
That keep on falling from your mouth 
Falling from your mouth 
Falling from your mouth 
Tell me... 
Why 
Why 

I may be mad 
I may be blind 
I may be viciously unkind 
But I can still read what you're thinking 
Let's go down to the water's edge 
And we can cast away those doubts 
Some things are better left unsaid 
But they still turn me inside out 
Turning inside out turning inside out 
Tell me... 
Why 
Why 
Tell me... 
Why You don't knew 
Why You don't knew 

This is the book I never read 
These are the words I never said 
This is the path I'll never tread 
These are the dreams I'll dream instead 
And these are the years that we have spent 
And this is what they represent 
And this is how I feel 
Do you know how I feel ? 
'cause i don't think you know how I feel 
I don't think you know what I feel 
Why You don't knew 
Why You don't know what I feel 
Why You don't knew 
Why don't know what I feel
