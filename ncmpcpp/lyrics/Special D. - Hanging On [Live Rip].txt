I'm in the phone booth, it's the one across the hall.
If you don't answer, I'll just ring it off the wall.
I know he's there, but I just had to call.
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone.
I heard your mother, now she's going out the door.
Did she go to work or just go to the store?
All those things she said, I told you to ignore.
Oh why can't we talk again?
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone.
It's good to hear your voice, you know it's been so long.
If I don't get your calls then everything goes wrong.
I want to tell you something you've known all along.
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone.
I had to interrupt and stop this conversation.
Your voice across the line gives me a strange sensation.
I'd like to talk when I can show you my affection.
Oh I can't control myself!
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone.
Hang up and run to me! Oh!
