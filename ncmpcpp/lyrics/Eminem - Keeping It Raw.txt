Where's my snare? 
I have no snare on my headphones 
There you go 
Yeah 
Yo yo 


Have you ever been hated, or discriminated against? 
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against 
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times 
Sick as the mind, of the mother fucking kid that's behind 
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans exploding 
Tempers flaring from parents just blow em off and keep going 
Not taking nothing from no one, give em hell long as I'm breathing 
Keep kicking ass in the morning, and taking names in the evening 
Leave them with a taste sour as vinegar in they mouth 
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out 
Look at me now, I betcha prolly sick of me now 
Ain't you mama, I'ma make you look so ridiculous now 

I'm sorry mama 
I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleaning out my closet 
One More Time 

I said I'm sorry mama 
I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleaning out my closet 
Ha! 


I got some skeletons in my closet 
And I dont know if no one knows it 
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it 
I'ma expose it, I'll take you back to '73 
Before I ever had a multi-platinum selling CD 
I was a baby maybe I was just a couple of months 
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch 
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye 
No I don't, on second thought I just fucking wished he would die 
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leaving her side 
Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I try to make it work 
With her atleast for Hailie's sake I maybe made some mistakes 
But I'm only human but I'm man enough to face them today 
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb 
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun 
Cause I'd of killed em, shit I would've shot Kim and him both 
It's my life, I'd like to welcome ya'll to the Eminem show 

I'm sorry mama 
I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleaning out my closet 
One More Time 

I said I'm sorry mama 
I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleaning out my closet 
Ha!


Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition 
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissing 
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision 
Witnessing your mama popping prescription pills in the kitchen 
Bitching that someone's always going through her purse when shit's missing 
Going through public housing systems, victim of munchhausen syndrome 
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 
'Til I grew up, now I blew up it makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it? 
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, ma? 
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma? 
But guess what, your getting older now and it's cold when your lonely 
And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that your phoney 
And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful 
But you'll never see her, she wont even be at your funeral *hahaha*
See what hurts me the most, is you wont admit you was wrong 
Bitch, do your song, keep telling yourself that you was a mom 
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get 
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit! 
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? 
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be 
I'm sorry mama 
I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleaning out my closet 
One More Time 

I said I'm sorry mama 
I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleaning out my closet 
Ha!
