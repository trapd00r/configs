Under a lovers' sky 
Gonna be with you 
And noone's gonna be around 
If you think that you won't fall 
Well just wait until 
Til the sun goes down 

Underneath the starlight - starlight 
There's a magical feeling - so right 
It'll steal your heart tonight 

You can try to resist 
Try to hide from my kiss 
But you know 
But you know that you can't fight the moonlight 
Deep in the dark 
You'll surrender your heart 
But you know 
But you know that you can't fight the moonlight 
No, you can't fight it 
It's gonna get to your heart 

There's no escape from love 
Once a gentle breeze 
Weaves it's spell upon your heart 
No matter what you think 
It won't be too long 
Til your in my arms 
Underneath the starlight - starlight 
We'll be lost in the rhythm - so right 
Feel it steal your heart tonight 

You can try to resist 
Try to hide from my kiss 
But you know 
But you know that you can't fight the moonlight 
Deep in the dark 
You'll surrender your heart 
But you know 
But you know that you can't fight the moonlight 
No you can't fight it 
No matter what you do 
The night is gonna get to you 

Don't try then 
You're never gonna win 

Underneath the starlight - starlight 
There's a magical feeling - so right 
It will steal your heart tonight 

You can try to resist 
Try to hide from my kiss 
But you know 
But you know that you can't fight the moonlight 
Deep in the dark 
You'll surrender your heart 
But you know 
But you know that you can't fight the moonlight 
No, you can't fight it 

You can try to resist 
Try to hide from my kiss 
But you know 
Don't you know that you can't fight the moonlight 
Deep in the dark 
You'll surrender your heart 
But you know 
But you know that you can't fight the moonlight 
No, you can't fight it 
It's gonna get to your heart
