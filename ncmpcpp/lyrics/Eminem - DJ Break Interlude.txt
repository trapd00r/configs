Power.. pow.. power... 

Guess who's back? Hahaha, here we go 

It's ninety-fo', what's next? 

Power.. enter my world 

I guess this year gonna be a motherfucker for real niggaz 

I swear these playa haters done got a taste of power 

It ain't all good in the hood 

Least not on my side, from where I stand 

And the law? Man, fuck the law! 

Niggaz must outthink, outstep, and continue to outsmart 

the motherfuckin law, in every way 

Key word in ninety-four is 'down low' 

Gots to be struggling 

I see how the rich got theirs 

Nigga I'm legit, shit 

Where do we go from here? 

(Who's afraid, of the punk police? 

To my niggaz run the streets, fuck peace) --&gt; repeat in background 

Heyyy niggaz, where your heart at? 

See motherfuckers killin babies, killin mommas 

Killin kids, puttin this in they motherfuckin mark 

Now what type of mixed up trick would kill the future of our race 

before he would he look his enemy dead in the eye, and open fire? 

These crazy motherfuckers got toys with guns 

Jails for guns, but still, no god damn jobs 

And they wonder why we loc'n up 

Where do we go from here? 

Where do we go? 

*singers singing variations of 'Where do we go from here'* 

All you niggaz out there 

The clouds shook, the world listened 

We stood together in April of ninety-two 

With duty, and a sense of honor 

There is no limit to what WE can achieve 

That's all on us... us... 

Not my niggaz, not the whites, not the enemies 

or none of them motherfuckers, US 

What can WE do? Shit 

I declare a death sentence to all child molestors 

Fake-ass bitches, male and female 

And all you punk-ass snitches 

We can do without your asshole 

Let no man break, what we set 

Where do we go from here? 

Rest in peace, to Cato, I miss you 

All the other real G's that passed away in ninety-three 

In ninety-four, and more 

What do we do? For us?
