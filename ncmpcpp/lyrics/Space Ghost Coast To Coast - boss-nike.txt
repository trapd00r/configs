Outkast Bust Lyrics
(feat. Killer Mike) 

[Intro:] Ghosts and goblins run amock 
In the caverns of rhine 
Slinging petty corruption 
The seventh sign! 

[Hook:] Yeah!!!! 
Give to you and I do what it takes! 
To give it to you! 
Wars, wars! 

[Big Boi:] Step into the realms os space where nobody goes 
Only the baddest motherfuckas are the ones that are chose! 
Some of the coolest individuals on the planet we said 
Best believe that we can buck or give a damn if we cared! 
No collision supervision but my family is here 
Now my mama taught my niggaz that was under the stairs 
One of those who chauffeured life and then was unprepared 
But my hunger is the thought that no wonder it can't be smothered 
Or buttered up, buttercup, melt your sauce 
You a Chucky Cheese bouncer chumpin' off the boss 
What I'm trying to tell you now is that you're softer that soft 
And I'm sick as a cough, did I mention it's raw? 
Your predicaments flaw 
Flaw means fucked up and serving out the oven not fried, slow roast 
No coast, tuck your tail and hide! 
You scared? 

[Hook] 

[Killer Mike:] I officially do it with duns on tour 
We lock down traps, push caps galore 
My wiz cook work `til it scale like fish 
My old earth even known to handle biz 
I serve whipped, out of whips, whip out cash 
Usually keep a G packed under the dash 
Try to test my gangsta, I bring harm 
I'm as slick as Freeway Rick and Nicholas Barnes 
My uptown Nikes hold caps and cheddar 
My waistline hold a 4-pound Baretta 
I'll shoe lace your face just to learn you better 
My ox so sharp it cut through leather 
My rap name Killer, my street name Skunk 
I mastered the music that was born in the BRonx! 
I switch my slang spit from my mouth 
I'm still all coast, my coust the South!!! 

(Hook)
