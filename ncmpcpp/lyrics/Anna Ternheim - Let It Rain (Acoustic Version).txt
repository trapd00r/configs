Leaving on a Mayday, fine summer pain
in his heart on his tounge, the taste is sweet again
Leaving on a Mayday, fine summer pain
But he said a feather, and his mind can take all, his feet are moving again

Let it rain, on me, let it rain
Let it rain, on me, let it rain

Morning comes, wakes him up, he looks out at the parking lot
Sees the house, he was born, almost 57 years ago
Where his brother lives, where his sister moved, and all three went to unfinished school
Where the father died, in '59, and mother did in 63'
He's reminded of her when he looks at me.

Let it rain, on me, let it rain
Let it rain, on me, let it rain
Let it rain, on me, let it rain
Let it rain, on me, let it rani
That's how, that's how all things grow
That's how, that's how all things grow

I've been waiting for the noosy set, 20 years I've been waiting
For the last pages in a book I read, of love, death and endless need
About you, your sister your mother and me, even the happiest families bleed.
I want to get even, making it last, get every bastard from the past

Let it rain, on me, let it rain
Let it rain, on me, let it rain
Let it rain, on me, let it rain
Oh let it rain, on me, that's how
That's how all things grow, that's how
That's how all things grow, that's how
That's how all things grow, that's how
That's how all things grow

Want to get even, making last, get every bastard from the past
Want to get even, making last, get every bastard from the past
Want to get even, making last, get every bastard from the past
