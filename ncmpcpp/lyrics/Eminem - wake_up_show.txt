[Eminem] 
Yo  speed racer  97' burgundy Blazer 
Wanted for burglary  had to ditch the mercury tracer 
I'm on some low ish  
I'm fed up wit the being broke ish 
I'm not to joke wit 
Bitch  I don't sell crack  I smoke it 
My brains dusted; I'm disgusted at all my habits 
Too many asprin tablets and empty medicine cabinets 
Loosing battles to wack rappers 'cause I'm always too blunted 
Walkin' up in the cypher smokin', talkin' like, "Who want it?" 
Thug and crook; every drug in the book I've done it 
My 9's at your frame,is that your chain? Run it 
Who wants to die of an overdose of excessive flavor? 
Aggressive nature got me stickin' you for your Progressive pager 
Spectacular, battle rap manufacturer 

Stole your mom's Acura, wrecked it, then sold it back to her 
( Right right right ! ! ! ) (( Ding ! ! ! )) 
The doctors you'll need after our battle are known as psychiatrics 
I'll tell the nurses to hold a bed for you, 
and I'ma make sure you come back for it 
So barricade your infants, put up some extra fences 
A woman beater, wanted for repeated sex offenses ( Ooh ) 
..Take em' on long vacation trips 
Kidnappin' em' and trappin' em' in abusive relationships 
Mess up your face and lips 
Slit your stomach and watch your gut split 
Gut you wit that razor that I use to shave my nuts wit ((Laughter)) 
Mama don't you cry, your son's too far gone 
I'm so high, I don't even know what label I'm on 
I'm messed up, feelin' like an over worked plumber 
I'm sick of the crap, what's Dr. Kevorkian's phone number? ( Ha.. Hot )
