Yes, I can see her
'Cause every girl here wanna be her
Oh, she's a diva
I feel the same and I wanna meet her
They say she low down, it's just a rumor and I don't believe 'em 
They say she needs to slow down
The baddest thing around town

She's nothing like a girl you've ever seen before
Nothing you can compare to your neighborhood whore
I'm trying to find the words to describe this girl without being disrespectful
The way that booty movin' I can't take no more
Had to stop what I'm doing so I can pull up close
I'm trying to find the words to describe this girl without being disrespectful

Damn, girl!

Damn, you's a sexy bitch, a sexy bitch
Damn, you's a sexy bitch, damn, girl!
Damn, you's a sexy bitch, a sexy bitch
Damn, you's a sexy bitch, damn, girl!
