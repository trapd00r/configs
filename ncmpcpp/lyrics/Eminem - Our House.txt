(E) = eminem as eminem
(D) = eminem as his mom

Here's the story... Of a little boy
Growing up in a suburban home
Tryin to cope with everyday life
He lives in a little house
That was built in the middle of the street

(E)
Hey mom tupac's on the juke box
(D)
So what, he shot 2 cops
And raped a little girl watchin news watch
(E)
Nuh ahh they were tryna frame him
(D)
You and that Tu Pac shakur
(E) 
No that ain't how you say his name mom
You're so lame.. Dont you know anything?
(D)

(E)

(D)
Stop Cussin at me!
(E)
Shut up bitch!
(D)

(E)
Well slammed the door and I'm out
Now what? It's probably warm in the house
Fuck, I forgot my jacket
I forgot it was winter
I'm Gettin Thinner
I'm hungry, is mom cookin dinner?
Mom let me back in i forgot my coat!
Mom come on I'm not playin its cold!
Aight sorry I need a jacket
Mom look! My TuPac tape I just cracked it!
Mom please let me back in
It is TuPac Shakur
I just asked him!
I'm Freezing (*sneeze*) I'm Sneezing
I'm breathing to much cold air
I'm Wheezing
I ain't did nothin
I ain't say im leaving 
I said I'm goin on the front porch to get something!
(*cutting noises*)
(D)
Aight Here Take Your Damn Coat And Leave!
(E)
Fine I'll leav--Mom You Cut Off The Sleaves!!

(chorus)
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...(1, 2 ,3)
In the middle of the street

(E)
My teacher's two faced
He went to lower all my school grades
Cuz last thursday i had a tooth ache  from kool-aid
So mom kicked me out
(D)
Get Out!!
(E)
All i had was my suitcase, 
A shoelace, a tube sock 
And a tube of toothpaste
Sometimes it was cool
Cuz i could go to a freinds
Crash there, fool around and just skip school
But other times I'd rather be home
In my own room, Alone
beatin my shit 
And nobody would know
My little brother sucked on a bottle till he was six
So I'd hide it inside the couch and say
"I don't know where it is.."
But as soon as mom found it
I would either get grounded
Or kicked out of the house a thousand weeks
I'm still countin!
Even when I was under age......
Mom was tellin cops i was tryna run away......
I told her "Some day bitch, you gonna pay...."
Please mom please mom please I wanna stay....
(Let me stay!)

(chorus)
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...(yo)
In the middle of the street

(E)
My brothers incoharent
Moms a single parent
Who ain't caring, Staring through me like I'm transparant
Made it clear that i was just there to run her errands
Told her friends that i was the son from her last marrage
Sent me up to the corner store with a little note
(D)
Please sell my stepson ciggarettes so i can smoke.
(E)
One time i tried to fake a stich to get attention..
Back fired and mom sent me to school with vengence
My life is the worst thing that could ever have happened to me
I go to class and every teachers always laughing at me
Mom says "white rappers always get laughed at"
Not only that, she heard me upstairs and i can't rap
But I'm stupid 
I'll never make it average or a D+
I need to sit on my ass
And just sue people like she does
One time I got food poisening from a hotdog
Mom sued and got $2000 from Ballpark
Hey mom you got a doller?
(D)
I don't Think so
Now keep an eye on your brother,
I'm Going to bingo
(E)
But mom you said.. you were broke
(D)
who said? 
You got your ears messed up (awwww)
From that damn rap music

(chorus to fade)
