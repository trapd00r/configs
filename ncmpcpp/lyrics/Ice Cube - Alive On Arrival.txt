Down at the best spot
Its me and JD and they sellin more birds than a pet shop
The spot's hot and everybody nervous
That's when the blue car served us
Oh why did fools had to let loose
Heard six pops from a deuce deuce
Big Tom had to push us
13 niggaz runnin straight to the bushes
For they gats so they could draw down
But why a motherfucker like me had to fall down
Not known why I dropped out
Fuck it, still can't afford to get popped out
So now I gotta jet
Only ran one block, but my shirt soakin wet
Tryin to see if we got him
Looked down at my sweatshirt red at the bottom
Didn't panic but I still looked cracked out
Yelled to the homies then I blacked out

Woke up in the back of a tray
On my way, to MLK
That the county hospital jack
Where niggaz die over a little scratch
Still sittin in the trauma center
In my back is where the bullet entered
Yo nurse I'm gettin kind of warm
Bitch still made me fill out the fuckin form
Coughin up blood on my hands and knees
Then I heard "freeze nigger don't move"
Yo, I didn't do a thing
Didn't wanna go out like my man Rodney King
Still got gaffled
Internal bleeding as the bullet starts to travel
Now I'm handcuffed
Being asked information on my gang affiliation
I don't bang, I rock the good rhymes
And I'm a victim of neighborhood crime

I need to see a MD
And ya'll mothafuckers giving me the third degree
Look at the waiting room
Its filled to the rim like the county jail day room
Nobody gettin help
Since we poor
The hospital move slow
Now I'm layed out
People steppin over me to get closer to the tv
Just like a piece of dog shit
Now will I die on this nappy ass carpet
One hour done passed
Done watched two episodes of M*A*S*H
And when I'm almost through
They call my name and put me on ICU
Halfway dead
No respect and handcuffed to the bed
Now the trauma starts
Cause the bullet must be just a hair from my heart
So I begin the ass kissin
Just to get looked at by an overworked physician
Got the chills, but my temperatures 103
Only got a band-aid and an IV
That's when I start cussin
Police steady askin me who did the bustin

Why oh why can't I get help
Cause I'm black, I gots to go for self
Too many black bodies the hospital housin
So at 10 P.M. I was Audi 5000
