We've got stars directing our fate
And we're praying it's not too late
Millennium 

Some say that we are players
Some say that we are pawns
But we've been makin' money 
Since the day that we were born
Got to slow down( slow down)
'Cause we're low down

Run around in circles
Live a life of solitude
'Till we find ourselves a partner
Someone to relate to
Then we'll slow down
Before we fall down

We've got stars directing our fate
And we're praying it's not too late
'Cause we know we're falling from grace
Millennium 

Live for liposuction, detox for your rent 
Overdose for Christmas and give it up for Lent
My friends are all so cynical 
Refuse to keep the faith 
We all enjoy the madness 
'Cause we know we're gonna fade away

We've got stars directing our fate
And we're praying it's not too late
'cause we know we're falling from grace
Millennium 

Come and have a go 
If you think you are hard enough 
Come and have a go 
If you think you are hard enough
Millennium, millennium 

We've got stars directing our fate
And we're praying it's not too late 
'Cause we know we're falling from grace
Millennium 

(Sometimes you know) 

And when we come we always come too late
I often think that we were born to hate
Get up and see the sarcasm in my eyes

And when we come we always come too late 
I often think that we were born to hate
Get up and see the sarcasm in my eyes

We've got stars directing our fate (Millennium) 
And we're praying it's not too late (Millennium) 
'Cause we know we're falling from grace (Millennium) 

(And we won't stop) 

We've got stars directing our fate 
And we're praying it's not too late 
'Cause we know we're falling from grace 
Millennium 

(Repeat to fade)
