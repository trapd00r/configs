I saw your name in a telephone book 
As someone unlisted someone unknown 
I guess you want to disappear 
To another world 
Where you're left on your own

And I know we could close our eyes 
And fool ourselves 
With nowhere left to hide 
I thought that giving up 
Would be easier 
But it's harder not to try

Cause in your heart is a hurt that's growing 
You're like a window to my world 
Where no begin is where you are

I love you like an aeroplane 
That's taking me home again 
I'm standing here in line 
Cause some love just takes time

I love you like an aeroplane 
That's bringing me home again 
If you're searching for the truth 
It's in the feelings I have for you 
It's in the feelings I have for you

They say 
Some things are forever and 
Some things they only last a day 
It it's not getting better 
If it's difficult 
Doesn't mean you turn away

I know you live your life 
Like a melody 
A song that wants to grow 
I thought that giving up 
Would be easier 
But it's harder letting go 
Cause in your heart is a hurt that's growing 
You're like a window to my world 
Where to begin is where you are

I love you like an aeroplane 
That's taking me home again 
I'm standing here in line 
Cause some love just takes time

I love you like an aeroplane 
That's taking me home again 
If you're searching for the truth 
It's in the feelings I have for you

I saw your name in a telephone book 
As someone unlisted someone unknown 
I guess you want to disappear 
To another world 
Where you're left on your own

And I know we could close our eyes 
And tell yourself 
That's there's not much we can do 
But I'm not giving up 
I'm not giving up 
On these feelings I have for you 
Yeah these feelings I have for you 
These feelings I have for you 
These feelings I have for you 
These feelings I have for you
