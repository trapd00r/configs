I wait in the darkness.
Frozen winds surround my face.
In the cover of darkness I can make believe it's you.
I feel you like the rain,
I feel you like a storm cloud building in my heart.
I wonder if you know the pain, to want the one thing you haven't got.

Just a twist in time ...and you could be mine
Just a sip of wine ...and you could be mine
Just a kiss devine

A hand brushes by my love.
A smile fuels a steel inferno
You don't have to die to leave my world.
Stand still and you've departed.
It seems I'm not on your mind and I'm wasting my time.
I'm just a fool to believe.
In the death of the night can you feel me inside?
I wish that you could conceive..

Just a twist in time ...and you could be mine
Just a sip of wine ...and you could be mine
Just a kiss devine ...and you could be mine

Won't you leave me in the darkness.
Take away the pride, all the dignity that's burning inside.
Can't you see I'm standing naked.
I'll bear all the crosses and the crucifixes you can provide.
If you could decide.

Just a twist in time ...and you could be mine
Just a sip of wine ...and you could be mine
Just a kiss devine ...and you could be mine
