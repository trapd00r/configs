Make your escape
You're my own papillon
The world turns too fast
Feel love before it's gone

It kicks like a sleep twitch
My papillon
Feel love when it's shone

It kicks like a sleep twitch

Darling
Just don't put down your guns yet
If there really was a God here
He'd have raised a hand by now
Now darling
You're born, get old, then die here
Well that's quite enough for me
We'll find our own way home somehow

No sense of doubt
Or what you could achieve
Well, I found you out
I've seen the life you wish to leave

But when it kicks like a sleep twitch
You will choke
Choke on the air you try to breathe

It kicks like a sleep twitch

Darling
Just don't put down your guns yet
If there really was a God here
He'd have raised a hand by now
Darling
You're born, get old, then die here
Well, that's quite enough for me, dear
We'll find our own way home somehow
How, how

It kicks like a sleep twitch
It kicks like a sleep twitch

Darling
Just don't put down your guns yet
If there really was a God here
He'd have raised a hand by now
Darling
Oh, you're born, get old, then die here
Well, that's quite enough for me, dear
We'll find our own way home somehow

It kicks like a sleep twitch

It kicks like a sleep twitch
