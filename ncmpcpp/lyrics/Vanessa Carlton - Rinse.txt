She'd do anything to sparkle in his eyes
She would suffer, she would fight and compromise
She's been wishin' up the stars that shine so bright 
For answers to questions that will haunt her tonight

She must rinse
This all away
She can't hold him this way
She must rinse
This all away
She can't love him
This way

How she'd be soothed, how she'd be saved, if he could see
She needs to be held in his arms to be freed
But everything happens for reasons that she will never understand
Till she knows that the heart of a woman will never
Be found in the arms of a man

She must rinse
This all away
She can't hold anybody this way
She must rinse
This all away
She can't love him

And as she runs away, she fears she won't be followed
What could be worse than leaving something behind
And as the depth of oceans slowly become shallow
Its loneliness she finds
If only he was mine

She'd do anything to sparkle in his eyes
She would suffer, she would fight and compromise
She's been wishin' up the stars that shine so bright
For answers to questions that will haunt her tonight

She must rinse him
She must rinse him
She can't rinse him
She can't rinse him
She can't, she won't, she must rinse him
She can't, she wont, she must rinse him

She must rinse 
This all away
She can't hold him this way 
She must rinse
This all away
She can't love him
This way
