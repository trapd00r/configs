White Trash Beautiful, Trailor Park Queen 
She slings hash at the diner from 11 to 5 
She married a boy from school, thought he was oh so cool 
But all he can do for money is drive 
Out late haulin' freight on Interstate 5, prayin' he'll see home before his baby arrive 

White Trash Beautiful, There's something you should know 
My heart belongs to you 
I know you coulda found a better guy 
I'll love you till the day I die 
I swear to God it's true 
I'm comin' home to you 
I'm comin' home to you girl 

He lights a cigarette, his eyes half open 
He won't be home tonight, but she keeps hopin' 
Drinkin himself to sleep is his only way of copein' 
She waits for him every night, she leaves the front door open 
It's 4 AM and doin 95, Tryin to stay awake and make it home alive 

White Trash Beautiful, There's something you should know 
My heart belongs to you 
I know you coulda found a better guy 
I'll love you till the day I die 
I swear to God it's true 
I'm comin' home to you 
I'm comin' home to you girl 

Her lip stick's painted red, her nametag's crooked 
Her heart's been gone awhile with the truck driving man that took it 
He keeps her photograph on his rearview mirror 
She prays for him every night, she hopes that he can hear her 

White Trash Beautiful, There's something you should know 
My heart belongs to you girl 
I know you coulda found yourself a better guy 
I'll love you till the day I die 
I swear to God it's true 
I'm comin' home to you 
I'm comin' home to you girl 
I'm comin' home to you
