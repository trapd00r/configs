Read my lips
I'm into you
I'm into you
I can't resist
You're so hot (get me into the shade)
The spotlight's on
You creep into it
You like it, and
Just the way that you dance
Just the way that you dance

(Yeah yeah) Is enough to love you baby
(Yeah yeah yeah) Is enough to send me crazy
(Yeah yeah) Such angelic motion
(Yeah yeah yeah) You know you're made in heaven

The way you walk, the rhythm when you're dancing
Every inch of you spells out desire
You're such a rush, the rush is never ending
Now, You got it, you're wow wow wow wow
You got it, you're wow wow wow wow

The more I try, I try to stop
The more I can feel my antenna just sensing you up
What can I do? I'm into you
I'm into you
Love the way that you move
Just love the way that you move

(Yeah yeah) Such angelic motion
(Yeah yeah yeah) you know you're made in heaven

The way you walk, the rhythm when you're dancing
Every inch of you spells out desire
You're such a rush, the rush is never ending
Now, You got it, you're wow wow wow wow
You got it, you're wow wow wow wow

Woah-woah oh ohh
Woah-woah ohhh
Woah-woah oh ohh
Woah-woah ohhh

The way you walk, the rhythm when you're dancing
Every inch of you spells out desire
You're such a rush, the rush is never ending
Now, You got it, you're wow wow wow wow
The way you walk, the rhythm when you're dancing
Every inch of you spells out desire
You're such a rush, the rush is never ending
Now, You got it, you're wow wow wow wow
You got it, you're wow wow wow wow
