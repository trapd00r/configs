Just a smile and the rain is gone
Can hardly believe it (yeah)
There's an angel standing next to me
Reaching for my heart

Just a smile and there's no way back
Can hardly believe it (yeah)
But there's an angel calling me
Reaching for my heart

I know, that I'll be ok now
This time it's real

(Chorus)
I lay my love on you
It's all I wanna do
Every time I breathe
I feel brand new
You open up my heart
Show me all your love, and walk right through
As I lay my love on you

I was lost in a lonely place
Could hardly believe it (yeah)
Holding on to yesterday
Far, far too long

Now I believe it's ok cause
This time it's real

Repeat Chorus

I never knew that love could feel so good
Like a once in a lifetime
You change my world

I lay my love on you
You make me feel brand new
Show me your love and walk right through (oh, yeah)
As I lay my love on you

Chorus

I lay my love on you
You make me feel brand new
Show me all your love and walk right through
As I lay my love on you

As I lay my love on you
