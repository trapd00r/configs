[C-Murder]
You talk a good one shorty, you make me sweat
How a thug nigga like girl?
[Da Brat]
Nice and wet
You makin me hot and horny with what you poppin so far
How a tru bitch like it C?
[C-Murder]
Nice and hard

[C-Murder]
You kinda fly, you kinda shy
Wha'cha eat, wha'cha drive
And you like them ghetto boys
The ones who make that noise
You know I'm thugged out, you know I do this, you know I do that
And for a fact, you know I do things that make my pocket fat
Cuz I'm tru, I hang with the man, you gave me the game
Plus I'm fame, and now ya'll scream my name
Call me a jogger, cuz you got me sweatin your style
I ran a couple miles 
and some, see where I'm comin from
I like em smooth, with cat eyes, and iced-out, and show 'nough
You need the handcuffs, that rough stuff
You talk a good one shorty, I mean that
Now won't you lay on'r back, 
Let a thug between that

Chorus: 2x

[Da Brat]
You kinda sexy, you kinda ghetto, with them slugs in your front
C-Murder, can you hold me down, give a thug girl what she want
Money and nice cars
A house with a pool in the backyard
Take me shoppin with No Limit, on the credit card
? this shrimp, push a Lambragini ta sick
Drink Crystal when it's cold, I wanna mint the stick
Go on and do this, and do that
When you come home, to Brat
You'll never want another girl again, this thug blew th
Gimme the loot, so I can cop a new Jag
And Brat dat I got it from you, 
With a 45 caliber too
In case a nigga run up on me, I got somethin to shoot

Chorus: 2x

[Da Brat]
We ride together
Survive and die together
I ain't leaving you never
Tougher the leather, make it last forever

[C-Murder]
That's what I need Brat
I hope you mean dat
But yet these cat take these keys
Let me show you where the cheese at

[Da Brat]
I can love you innocently
Bring home at least 20 g's a week
From hustlin in da street

[C-Murder]
Uh huh
And I'ma take dat, then hit dat, then flip dat, then finish wit dat
And hit you back, when you can trip cruise on a ship

[Da Brat]
Now I hold it down for you, you hold it d

[C-Murder]
Uh huh
And I'ma ride for you 
If you ride for me
I would even, die for you 
Now would you die for me

Chorus: 2x
