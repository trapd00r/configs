Acetaminophen
You see the medicine
Girl, you have no faith in medicine

Is there a way to find the cure for this
Implanted in a pill?
Is it just the name upon the bottle
That determines if it will?

Is the problem you're allergic
To a well familiar name?
Do you have a problem with this one
If the results are the same?

Acetaminophen
You see the medicine
Girl, you have no faith in medicine

Well strip the bark right off a tree
And just hand it this way
Don't even need a drink of water
To make the headache go away
Give me sugar pill
And watch me just rattle
Down the street
