[Eminem]
Good morning
Haha, wake your mother fucking asses up
Yo what is the what?
Well come on then, you know what time it is
Stop sleeping on my roof bitch!

For whatever it's worth it's worth me having my ass whipped
Cause I'ma have the last lift that ever gets ass squished
I just can't get past these little peasants
That wanna be rauny bad asses so bad
And they so mad they can't stand it
Cause we can and they can't spit (Hawk)
And they can't handle it like a man
And that's when it just happens
And I snap and it's a wrap, and it's a scrap an then it isn't crap is it?
Hip-Hop isn't a sport anymore when you got to go and resort back into that shit
Maybe I'm old fashioned but my passion
Is to smash anyone rapping without having a slapping
Believe me I'd much rather pick up a pencil than a pistol but I'm pissed now
But it all depends on just how far it get's took on the mic
Cause I'm telling you right now your not gonna like it
Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pulling you with me
You poke a stick at a big boy you get bit be 
These words stick to you like crazy glue
When you diss me cause they just bounce off me like bullets do fifty!
I'm the beautiful-est thing and your gonna miss me when I'm gone
Like Kieth Murry when he threw a stool and hit a girl accidentally
I do this for Swifty, Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy & Proof are you with me?

[Chorus: Eminem]
Come on an everybody come on an
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on an
Cause we get it on an till the break of dawn an
Wake your ass up motherfuckers quit yawning
Cause we ain't leaving till 6 in the morning
So have sing along with the words to the song an
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an
Fake like you know 'em motherfucking join in
Everybody come on an

[Swifty]
Its in the media pitted me of a beef starter
In a party with heat it's hard to keep me without one
Fuck slugs I'm walkin gloves with a shotgun
Constantly poping slugs they hot son, better not run
The bosses of all bosses a Holocaust to whoever ain't conscious
In a house full of dog shit,
I'ma gothic death project, you stop breathing
You die quicker than mach speed without bleeding
It ain't about what you reading
When you meet me better speak like a season's greetings
Either that or we'll be beefing free when
You niggas need a 'E' just to speak shit!
Your leader is a boutique bitch
Keep the heater where you can reach quick
I snipe you with it and we won't even keep it a secret
Nigga I did it from a mind of a mental patient
When glocks wave you can save that conversation for Satan
You brave?

[Chorus]

[Kuniva]
Yo yo I heard you niggas don't like us
But so what this beef is like
'What the fuck did he say in his rap Em?'
I can see that he's just a punk
I mean these niggas squeeze on me
Please I'm seeing guts
I don't need no enemies, as my family a couple trucks
Am I empty seeing them white I empty out them white to fight you
In front of every reporter that I don't like
No need for metaphors I get yours across when I write
So emotions enough to say "fuck you bitch, and I don't like you, WHAT!"
I might as well give this up like heavy sales
And just fuck an leave D12 and this blunt
We can't self destruct
I've never felt it this much
Come on fellas, get up
We got to fight like Bugs last night of his life

[Kon Artis]
I walk with a limp, pistol hanging off-a the hip
I'm awkward and quick enough an sick when sparking a fifth
Your carcass is split even the beef is partially thick
We can't take you serious, you a comedy skit
You probably wish that you could be out shooting them G's
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze
I can't believe you speaking on moving key's
But every time we hear you kick it
The only thing you selling is wolf tickets
I look wicked cause niggas will test your nut sack
So when they bust you better bust back
And get your guts clapped outa your stomach
And when they want it (yeah)
I bring a hundred niggas from runave
So get your gun and if you coming

[Chorus]
