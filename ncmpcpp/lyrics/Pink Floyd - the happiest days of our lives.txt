(Spoken) You, yes you. Stand still laddy!1

When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers who would
Hurt the children any way they could

By pouring their derision
Upon anything we did
And exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids

But in the town it was well known
When they got home at night, their fat and
Psychopathic wives would thrash them
Within inches of their lives
