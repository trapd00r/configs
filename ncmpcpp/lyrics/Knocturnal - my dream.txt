[Samuel Christian] 
You ready?

[Knoc-Turn'al]
Yes, ha ha ha
Yeah, yeah
Let's go, I like singing

[Knoc-Turn'al]
My music, my life, my heart, my soul
My music, my everything, I give my all
My wife, my daughter, my love, my dream
My mother, my father, my brother, my team
My camp, my squad, my house, my car
My boat, my shoes, my pants, my shirt
My coke, my sugar, my cream, my butter
My toast, my all, my queen, my folks

[Chorus: Samuel Christian]
My baby!
Walk like six strings talk like she's my
everything
My baby!
Loves me, hates me, leaves me, runs right right,
that sexy...
Baby!
All I know, she shed's all my confusion, so...
My baby!
Will not run from anything, I swear, this goes

[Knoc-Turn'al talking]
Lord will lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
Cause if you die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take

[Knoc-Turn'al]
She's thick, she's bad, so clean, she fine
She loves, she hates, she laughs, she cries
She hurts, she lies, she's Bonnie, I'm Clyde
She's ghetto, she's real, she sings, she rhymes
 
She comes, she goes, she lives, she dies
She sexy and bomb, she blows my mind
She stays in line, she's smart, she's funny
She's crafty and cunning, in the game she's
running
Her lips, her back, her waist, her thighs
Her face, her skin, her hair, her eyes
Her voice, her shape, her hips, her mind
Her love, her smile, her touch, her time

[Chorus]

[Knoc-Turn'al]
I'm typsy, I'm through, I'm drunk, I'm blunted
My way, my day, my life - I love it
I move, I groove, I shake, I love it
My friends, my kins, I like, I love it
I show, I prove, I live, I learn
I show, I teach, I run these streets
My kin, my heart, my heat
My rhythm, my rap, my beat 
My life, my head and my feet 
My heart, my soul, my candy, my cake
My platinum, my gold, my land, my gate
My Benz, my lake
My keys, my money, my love, my hate 
My clothes, my phone, my house, my home
My money, my comb
My sugar, my spice, my base, my chrome
My rhythm, my music, my home
My world, my girl, my life, my home, my...

[Chorus 2x - til fade]
