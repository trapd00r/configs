Here in my car
I feel safest of all
I can lock all my doors
It's the only way to live 
In cars

Here in my car
I can only receive
I can listen to you
It keeps me stable for days
In cars

Here in my car
Where the image breaks down
Will you visit me please
If I open my door 
In cars

Here in my car
I know I've started to think
About leaving tonight
Although nothing seems right 
In cars
