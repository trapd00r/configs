Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg
Snatched it off, and beat him over the fuckin' head with the peg
Go to bed with a keg, wake up with a forty
Mixed it with Alka-Seltzer and Formula 44-D

Fuck an acid tab, I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Waited until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead
No more said, case closed, end of discussion
I'm blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion

Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombest?!
We blowin' up your house, killing your parents and coming back to get your foster mommas
And I'm as good at keepin' a promise as Nostradamus

Cause I ain't making no more threats
I'm doing drive-bys in tinted corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head
Maybe more, 'cause I smoked crack today, yesterday, and the day before

Sabateur; walk the block with a labrador
Strapped with more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul-style galore, verbal cow manure
Comin' together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure!
