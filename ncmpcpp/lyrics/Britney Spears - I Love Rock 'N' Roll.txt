Hey, is this thing on?

I saw him dancing there by the record machine, ah.
I knew he must have been about 17
The beat was going strong, playin' my favorite song
I could tell it wouldn't be long 'till he was with me
(Yeah me)
I could tell it wouldn't be long 'till he was with me
(Yeah me)

CHORUS
Singing I love rock 'n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox baby
I love rock and roll
So come and take the time and dance with me

Owwwwwwwwwwww

He smiled so I got up and asked for his name
But that don't matter he said cuz it's all the same
He said can I take ya home, where we can be alone
And next we're moving on and he was with me
(Yeah me)
We were movin' on and singing that same old song
(Yeah me)

(CHORUS)

I love rock 'n' roll yeah
So put another dime in the jukebox baby 
I love rock 'n' roll
So cam and take the time and dance with me
He said, "Can I take you home where we can be alone?"
And next we're movin' on and he was with me
(Yeah with me)
And we were movin' on and singing that same old song
(Yeah with me)

CHORUS (x5)
