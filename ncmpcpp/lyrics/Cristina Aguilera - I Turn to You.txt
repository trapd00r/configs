When I'm lost, in the rain, in your eyes 
I know I'll find the light to light my way. 

When I'm scared, losing ground, when my world is going crazy, 
You can turn it all around yes

And when I'm down you're there pushing me to the top. 
You're always there givin' me all you've got. 

For a shield from the storm, for a friend for a love to keep me safe and warm, I turn to you.
For the strength to be strong, for the will to carry on, 
For everything you do for everything that's true I turn to you, yes. 

When I lose the will to win I just reach for you and I can reach the sky again. 
I can do anything, 'cause your love is so amazing, 
Cause your love inspires me. And when I need a friend you're always on my side, 
Givin' me faith to get me through the night. 

For a shield (for a shield) 
From the storm (from the storm) 
For a friend, for a love to keep me safe and warm. 
I turn to you. (I turn to you) 
For the strength (for the strength) 
To be strong for the will to carry on. 
For everything you do I turn to you. 
(oh yeah oh) 

For the arms to be my shelter through all the rain. 
For truth that will never change. 
For someone to lean on. 

For a heart I can rely on through anything. 
For the one who I can run to 
Oh yeah 
(so do you oh yeah)

For a shield from the storm, for a friend, for a love to keep me safe and warm 
(to keep me safe and warm, yeah) 
I turn to you (I turn to you) 
For the strength (for the strength yea) 
To be strong, for the will to carry on. 
For everything you do (everything you do) 
For everything that's true 
For everything you do 
For everything that's true 
I turn to you.
