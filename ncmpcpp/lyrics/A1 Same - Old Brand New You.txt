I can still remember the time 
You were there when I needed to hold
you, feel you 
Every time I ask you to find a new way
You lie a new way
It is gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

You've said you'd changed, but I'm afraid 
It's something I won't live to see
It seems so strange
That sometimes fate
Can appear to be so real and yet turn out to be
a fantasy 

[Brigde]
Same old line, one more time
Say you're gonna be, there for me
Say you'll change, change your ways
Never gonna kepp your promises
Same old game (you know it doesn't turn me on)
Brand new day (you're singing that same old song)
No more lies (if you don't want to find me gone,
gone, gone, gone, gone)

[Chorus]
Another night, another day
What can I say 
You're still the same old brand new you 
You break your promises in two 
What can I do
When you're the same old brand new you 

because of you, I guess we're through (through)
Is this the way it has to be
I've been a fool (I've been a fool)
A fool for you (a fool for you)
But I've got better things to do than let you walk all over me)

[Bridge] 

[Chorus]

I can still remember the time 
You were there when I needed to hold
you, feel you 
Every time I ask you to find a new way
You lie a new way
It is gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
