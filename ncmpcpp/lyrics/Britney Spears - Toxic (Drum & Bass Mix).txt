Baby, can't you see I'm calling?
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm falling 
There's no escape – I can't wait
I need a hit – baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm loving it

Too high, can't come down
Losin' my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now? 

With the taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin' under
With a taste of the poison paradise
I'm addicted to you: don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do: don't you know that you're toxic?

It's getting late to give you up
I took a sip from a devil's cup
Slowly, it's taking over me

Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Can you feel me now?

With the taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin' under
With the taste of the poison paradise
I'm addicted to you: don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do: don't you know that you're toxic?
Don't you know that you're toxic?

Taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin' under
With the taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you: don't you know that you're toxic?

With the taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin' under
With the taste of the poison paradise
I'm addicted to you: don't you know that you're toxic?

Intoxicate me now
With your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now
I think I'm ready now
Intoxicate me now
With your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now
