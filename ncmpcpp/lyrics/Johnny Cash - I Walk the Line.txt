I keep a close watch on this heart of mine 
I keep my eyes wide open all the time. 
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds 
Because you're mine, 
I walk the line 

I find it very, very easy to be true 
I find myself alone when each day is through 
Yes, I'll admit I'm a fool for you 
Because you're mine, 
I walk the line 

As sure as night is dark and day is light 
I keep you on my mind both day and night 
And happiness I've known proves that it's right 
Because you're mine, 
I walk the line 

You've got a way to keep me on your side 
You give me cause for love that I can't hide 
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide 
Because you're mine, 
I walk the line
