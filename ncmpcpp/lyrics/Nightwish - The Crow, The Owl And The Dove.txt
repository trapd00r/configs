Don't give me love, don't give me faith 
Wisdom nor pride, give innocence instead 
Don't give me love, I've had my share 
Beauty nor rest, give me truth instead 

A crow flew to me, kept its distance 
Such a proud creation 
I saw its soul, envied its pride 
But needed nothing it had 

An owl came to me, old and wise 
Pierced right through my youth 
I learned its ways, envied its sense 
But needed nothing it had 

Don't give me love, don't give me faith 
Wisdom nor pride, give innocence instead 
Don't give me love, I've had my share 
Beauty nor rest, give me truth instead 

A dove came to me, had no fear 
It rested on my arm 
I touched its calm, envied its love 
But needed nothing it had 

A swan of white, she came to me 
The lake mirrored her beauty sweet 
I kissed her neck, adored her grace 
But needed nothing she could give 

Gar tuht river
Ger te rheged
