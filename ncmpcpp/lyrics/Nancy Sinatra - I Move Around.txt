I?ve seen the Golden Gate at San Francisco Bay
I?ve seen the Empire State and walked down old Broadway
I?ve seen those Northern Lights in some Alaskan town
Since I saw you with her I move, I move around.

I?ve seen a movie star at Hollywood and Vine
I?ve seen the Zanzibar and heard the Big Ben chime
I?ve seen the Eiffel and I?ve been in new Cape Town
Since I saw you with her I move, yeah, I move around.

(Bridge)

I?ve seen a matador in Barcelona cry
I?ve seen old Singapore, the bridge on River Kwai
I?ve seen the Mardi Gras and been in one-horse towns
Since I saw you with her I move, Baby I move around

I keep movin? around
I keep on movin? around
