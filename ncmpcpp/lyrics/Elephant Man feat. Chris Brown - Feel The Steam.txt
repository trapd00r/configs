(feat. Chris Brown)

Hmm
Elephant Man
C. Breeze
Chris Brown for the ladies
(Give it to her)
Baby look at it startin to sweat
Grind it on me
I told her
I told her
I told her
I told her
Burn it up
I told her
I told her
I told her
I told her
Burn it up
Before all the club is on fire
No top Bueno Bueno
Watching her perspire

Now why don't you make my temperature rise
And I could not do because it's not in your size
I told her she may go loop because she criticized
...
Show me around town anytime you see me roll
Call me in the Benz anytime at wedding toll
...
...
(I can't understand him at all!)

Can you feel the steam?
Hot make you wanna scream
Shawty wanna leave with me
I know just what you need
Girl, let me make you body sweat
Come on come on make your body wet
I'm a make your body drift sweat
Girl I wanna see your chest wet

Community mean all that foolishness
If she want that booty booty all she cool with this
Don't make me leave you head, jump and twist
Come on I don't wanna hear you jump on this
If you don't hear me make you fall in the trap door
Hold on me forever and pop on the floor
Ain't no testimonial or size on the floor
Tell me when your ready, when your ready I'll go

Can you feel the steam?
Hot make you wanna scream
Shawty wanna leave with me
I know just what you need
Girl, let me make you body sweat
Come on come on make your body wet
I'm a make your body drift sweat
Girl I wanna see your chest sweat

We can get it on and
Til the early mornin
Feel your body callin
We can get it on and
Til the early mornin
Hear your body callin?
Girl

Hot make you wanna scream
Shawty wanna leave with me
I know just what you need
Girl, let me make your body sweat
Come on come on make your body wet
I'm a make your body drift sweat
Girl I wanna see your chest sweat

All in the club all tied to my parts
I know she can reach me if I drift too far
If I know what she wants, I can reach for the stars
...
I can feel your temperature, id love to turn on me know (make your body shake)
... (make your body shake)
Booty booty booty like an american booty, shake her
Before I go turn on her like a belly dancer

Can you feel the steam?
Hot make you wanna scream
Shawty wanna leave with me
I know just what you need
Girl, let me make you body sweat
Come on come on make your body wet
I'm a make your body drift sweat
Girl I wanna see your chest sweat
