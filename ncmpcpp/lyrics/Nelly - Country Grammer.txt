Hmmmmm 
I'm goin down down baby, yo' street in a Range Rover (c'mon) 
Street sweeper baby, cocked ready to let it go (HOT SHIT!) 
Shimmy shimmy cocoa what? Listen to it pound 
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

Mmmmm, you can find me, in St. Louis rollin on dubs 
Smokin on dubs in clubs, blowin up like cocoa puffs 
Sippin Bud, gettin perved and getting dubbed 
Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs 
And it's all because, 'ccumulated enough stretch 
Just to navigate it, wood decorated on chrome 
And it's candy painted, fans fainted - while I'm entertainin 
Wild ain't it? How me and money end up hangin 
I hang with Hannibal Lector (HOT SHIT!) so feel me when I bring
It 
Sing it loud (what?) I'm from the Lou' and I'm proud 
Run a mile - for the cause, I'm righteous above the law 
Playa my style's raw, I'm "Born to Mack" like Todd Shaw 
Forget the fame, and the glamour 
Give me D's wit a rubber hammer 
My grammar be's ebonics, gin tonic and chronic 
Fuck bionic it's ironic, slammin niggaz like Onyx 
Lunatics til the day I die 
I run more game than the Bulls and Sonics
