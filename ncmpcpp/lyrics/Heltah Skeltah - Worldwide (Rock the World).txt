Ruck:

Yo Sean Price spit precise vocal local
Niggaz know Im nice we bomb put you in a choke-hold
So dont go there queer your rhyme抯 boring still
Even if you did a jam featuring Lauryn Hill
Its a warning to chill
Fraudulent skills yall be kickin 
On tracks Im flippin
Makin a mil in a instant
Yo thats the difference
Between a pawn and a rook son
A souljah and a shipper from outta town up in Brooklyn

Rock:

Click boom
The lyrical rocket launcher 
That ran up on ya
Makin shit hot as Tiajuana
You niggaz get torn ta 
Pieces you shitty as a diaper
I strap on bombs and blow your face up like striker
Dont get me hyper
I a tear yourself bare
Like a pacifier
Stump more shit than Rowdy Roddy Piper
Plus Im the type a guy that likes ta
Start a fight for no reason like a life-a
Plus I huh switch to a sniper slug strike ya
KAPOW
Chest burnin like its on fire
Or catch a head-shot you best not move 
Says the red dot cuz that rock dredlock woo

Chorus: 2X


Ruck:

Pay particular
Attention to my extra-curricular
Way I be stickin ya on tracks wit guests thats slick and the
Enemies in my cipher
I should treat ya like a Kennedy and snipe ya
Remember me that nigga Tawl Sean
I never liked ya give me a lighter
Seans flipper than non-fiction when the drum hittin
The gods gifted
You know that you wont get done
Im artistic
Watch how fast I draw my gun

Rock: We gone rock the world, if not mother-ruck ya
Ruck: Headz wasnt ready
Rock: That was why we stuck ya 
Ruck: Stuck ya
Rock: We gone rock on
Ruck: Mother-ruck the world
Rock: Rock yo dome
Ruck: Mother-ruck your moms and girl

Rock:

To all my people in the PJs lock it down
You on some scared shit these days stop it now
Shit is forever drama we rig out forever Rock and Ruck
Relocate boy, I scar all boroughs like Chuck
And blatantly I shake MCs wit the verbal sense of turbulence
Some cat was sayin he could take it
We havent heard him since
It doesnt hurt to bend a finger g
Dont be mistaken b
The world is Ruck and Rock for the taking see

Chorus: 2X   

Rock: We gone rock the world, if not mother-ruck ya
Ruck: Headz wasnt ready
Rock: That was why we stuck ya 
Ruck: Stuck ya
Rock: We gone rock on
Ruck: Mother-ruck the world
Rock: Rock yo dome
Ruck: Mother-ruck your moms and girl

Rock: Word is bond
Ruck: Mother-ruck your moms and girl

Rock: We rock on
