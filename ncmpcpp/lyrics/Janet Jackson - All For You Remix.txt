Send "All for You (DJ Quick remix)" Ringtone to your Cell All my girls at the party 
Look at his body 
Shakin' that thing 
Like I never did see 
Got a nice package alright 
Guess I'm gonna have to ride it tonight 
Guess I'm gonna have to ride it tonight 

All for you 
If you really want it 
All for you if you say you need it 
All for you if you gotta have it 
All for you make a move 
All for you 

I see you staring out the corner of my eye 
You seem uneasy want to approach 
Throw me a line 
But then something inside you grabs you says who am I 
I know exactly cuz it happens with all the guys 

So you do what you gonna do 
Come on and talk to me 
Promise you won't even have an attitude 
I'll let you sit right next to me 
Don't join the list of other fools 
That ain't the way to be 
Yes, it's cool 
Yes, I'm in the mood 
Intimidations got that mind 

Can't be afraid or keep me waiting too long 
Before you know it 
I'll be outta here I'll be gone 
Don't try to be all clevercute, or even shy 
Don't have to work that hard 
Just be useful and let that be your guide 
So you do what you gonna do 
Come on and talk to me 
Promise you won't even have an attitude 
I'll let you sit right next to me 
Don't join the list with all the other fools 
That ain't the way to be 
Yes, it's cool 
Yes, I'm in the mood 
Intimidations got that mind 

All for you 
Tell me you're the only one 
Soon we'll be having fun 
Come over here and get some
