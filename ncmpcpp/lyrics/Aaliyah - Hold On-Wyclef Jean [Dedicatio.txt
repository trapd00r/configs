[Intro - Timbaland - talking]
Oh!
You know what?
([Wyclef:] good good good)
I go through a lot, since my baby girl's not here
Life ain't been the same for me
Lately I miss you very much
I want you to hear my pain that I go through (go through ...)

[Verse 1 - Timbaland + (Wyclef Jean)]
It's been three years (AH!), livin this fast life
I think on it, I know one day I won't have life
People don't know me over the time B
They don't wanna know me, they wanna know my G's
Le I quit, things ain't the same no more
But I'ma do my thing 'til there ain't no more (yeah)
I got a plan, I wonder how far I can go
I demand the best for myself, that's all I know
I, done seen the world become
Products of a revolution that we begun (yeah)
Make me wanna split a swisher, I need me one
They keep on copying what we done done
That's why I say ..

[Break - Timbaland]
I know you like my shoes, cause you walk in my shoes
And would you be prepared to see (would ya?)
A life full of money and a life full of girls
But a heart that's really in deep (feel my pain)
A lot of people yellin ("we love ya Timbaland")
But I know y'all really in need (ooo)
I don't know who's in my corner, don't know where is my corner
But I gotta grab all these leaves
So I must ..

[Chorus - Wyclef Jean]
Hey, Timbaland you gotta hold on (hold on)
But you got to be strong
Though the pain almost over
([Timbaland:] My pain almost over)
Look towards the sky, there's only one Jehovah
([Timbaland:] I can't quit yet), you can't quit

You gotta hold on, you got to be strong
([Timbaland:] Uh, my pain almost over)
Look towards the sky, there's only one Jehovah

[Verse 2 - Magoo + (Wyclef Jean)]
Pain, can't you see the pain in my eyes?
The lie behind my cries, don't you sympathize with me
You don't have to wonder when I come
You label me a bum, you fake it ain't suprisin me (yeah)
Funny how Oo got money, people come around
Soon as Oo fail, kick 'em to the ground (yeah)
Not just neighbors, the whole damn town
Own flesh and blood, said I was a clown
But as the world turns, my life can too
And like a gun kills, a knife can too (yeah)
I was stabbed thrice, how 'bout you?
Once by my mom, pops the other two
Child abuse kid, ward of the state
I know it was the past, but I just can't shake
How you had a kid, beat me like a slave
I was only three, how could I misbehave?
I didn't know better, you could teach me first
You said fuck that, then you beat me worse
It's pain in this verse, hard to go on (yeah)
Oo is a man, so I must hold on

[Break - Timbaland]
I know you like my shoes, cause you walk in my shoes
And would you be prepared to see (would ya?)
([Wyclef:] yeah)
A life full of money and a life full of girls
But a heart that's really in deep (feel my pain)
A lot of people yellin ("we love ya Maganoo")
But I know y'all really in need (ooo)
I don't know who's in my corner, don't know where is my corner
([Wyclef:] yeah)
But I gotta grab all these leaves, uh huh
So I must ..

[Chorus - Wyclef Jean]
You gotta hold on (hold on)
But you got to be strong
Though the pain almost over
([Timbaland:] my pain almost over)
Look towards the sky, there's only one Jehovah
([Timbaland:] I can't quit yet), can't quit

You gotta hold on (yeah)
You got to be strong (yeah)
([Timbaland:] my pain almost over)
Yeah, look towards the sky, there's only one Jehovah (yeah)

[Verse 3 - Wyclef Jean]
Yeah, yo, I seen Brooklyn turn into Crook-lyn
The youngn's they spend their life in central Crook-lyn (yeah)
I've seen prom queens, turn into prom fiends
Sometime I ask myself what happen to Dr. King's "Dream" (yeah)
I've seen best friends, turn to enemies
What made it sad, I had to sing at the eulogy
So hard for us to say goodbye
So I puff the lye and stay high (yeah)
The man you said was your fam in the park (yeah)
Saw your face spark when you found out he was a Narc (yeah)
Cause everybody wanna be Nino Brown
They wanna be Nino Brown, they wanna be Nino Brown (yeah)
And the girls they love the Nino Brown
They hug they Nino Brown, they lust for Nino Brown (yeah)
And the fiends they want the Nino Brown
The way he hold you down, when he comes around (yeah) [echo]

[Outro - Timbland - talking]
The pain never stops baby
Lele, I hope ya hear us
Cause life will never be the same without you girl
([Wyclef:] yeah)
Timbaland talkin to you
([Wyclef:] yeah, yo, yo)
We ain't used to nothin
This music industry, will never be the same without you
Nothin but pain, hard struggle
But me and Jimmy D, we're gonna keep ridin for ya
Cause life must go on
You must live on
So we gotta hold on, c'mon

(Hold on) uh, (hold on)
My pain almost over (hold on, hold on)
I can't quit yet (hold on, hold on)
My pain almost over (hold on, hold on)
Nah Lele, me and 'Goo we can't quit, OH!
