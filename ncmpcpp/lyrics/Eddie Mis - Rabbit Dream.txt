We'll go down in history
Me lovin' you
You lovin' me, yeah
Lyrics courtesy Top40db.

There's something about
The way you kiss
It's in the stars, baby
We can't miss, no

Before you came along
My heart was down
Then you walked right in
And turned my world around

The best year of my life
Is the year that just went by
Since I met you

The best year of my life
Is the year that you made
All my dreams come true
And you'll always be the one
And every year to come
Will be the best year of my life

Baby, since you came along
My life's turned into a song, yeah
And in your misty eyes I see
Way beyond eternity, yeah

Your special kind of lovin' never fades
It just keeps on growin'
Stronger every day

The best year of my life
Is the year that just went by
Since I met you

The best year of my life
Is the year that you made
All my dreams come true
And you'll always be the one
And every year to come
Will be the best year of my life

The best year of my life
Is the year that just went by
Since I met you

The best year of my life
Is the year that you made
All my dreams come true
And you'll always be the one
And every year to come
Will be the best year of my life

The best year of my life
