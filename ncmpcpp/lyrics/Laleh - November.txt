Well you know me
I've never been afraid
I always jump into it
With my whole heart and no shame
And the thoughts that I'm left with
Is making such a mess
There's nothing more confusing than the loss
You've caused yourself
And, all in all
I feel you're like me and

We're the trees still green in november
And I know I can't remember summer being so gone 
And I will play along 
But it feels, It feels so much 
That we don't know what we're doing 
And I never knew, never thought 
They could play along, honey 
But they don't know what they're doing

And I know I won't admit it
And I don't want to say it
But I still look for you in the park
On my way home each day
And no, I won't admit it
Not even to my friends
They think I'm doing well
And I even lie to myself

How long can you keep a secret from yourself 
Like that storm that blew me back two years 
To that first step I took away from you 
And the hope that you left 
It's hidden in my room and I'm a strong woman 
But sometimes I'm weak for you 
And on and on, I close my eyes and 
I'm still there, I'm still there

We're the trees still green in november
And I know I can't remember summer being so gone 
And I will play along
And it feels so much 
That we don't know what we're doing 
Oh, I never knew, never thought 
They could play along, honey 
But they don't know what they're doing

I close my eyes and I'm still there and
We're the trees still green in november
And I know I can't remember summer being so gone 
And I will play along
And it still feels so much 
That we don't know what we're doing 
And I never knew, never thought 
They could play along, honey 
But they don't know what they're doing

And could play along, honey 
But they don't know what they're doing
