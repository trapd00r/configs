 [Guru]  

 Mmm  is this really the end  or is it a new beginning?  

 A new reality..  

  

 Chorus: Guru + Baybe (repeat 2X)  

  

 So many misconceptions (don't be misled)  

 So many evil deceptions (oh I am)  

 I've come to give direction  

 For I  am the lifesaver (the life)  

  

 [Guru]  

 Scooby doo wah  scooby doo wee  

 Like a jazz player  I improvise wisely  

 Free with the style, I flow like the Nile  

 but remember, don't mistake the smile  

 Deep rooted is my rhymin  

 Like ancient African griots, precise is my timing  

 But let me get to the essence of what I'm sayin here  

 Too many blood red streets with bodies layin there  

 The systematic fanatics are at it again  

 Tryin to kill me and all of us my friend  

 But don't bend to the mental strain  

 Against all odds, we must strive for essential gains  

 Be true to the life the Lord gave ya  

 And that's a message from the lifesaver  

 The lifesaver..  

  

 Chorus  

  

 [Baybe]  

 Oh I am, the life (I.. am the lifesaver)  

 I am, the life.. yeah  

  

 [Guru]  

 It takes a more intelligent man to squash a fight  

 than to set one off, knowledge I'll let some off  

 Cause nowadays, everybody's a killer  

 And as for me, no other MC is iller  

 but still a thorn scrapes my heart  

 when I see another life that's been torn apart  

 over nonsense, no law, no order, it's evidence  

 that the money only takes precedence  

 Cause everybody wants power  

 While the innocent are born or die, during every hour  

 I scowl as I look upon evil  

 but I must have the strength, to spark awareness in my people  

 And we will learn to respect our neighbors  

 Another message from the lifesaver  

 The lifesaver..  

  

 Chorus  

  

 [Guru]  

 People talk about the Armaggedeon  

 And nowadays everyone you know is packin lead son  

 Each day's another test  

 Aiyyo I better do my best, cause a lot's ridin on my chest  

 So when I lead you to the water, you best know  

 how to swim across, so you can reach the border  

 It's international, the message and the flavor  

 So here's some more important words from the lifesaver  

 The lifesaver.. (I am the life)  

 The lifesaver..

 [Guru]  

 So many misconceptions  

 So many evil deceptions  

 I've come to give direction  

 For I, am the lifesaver
