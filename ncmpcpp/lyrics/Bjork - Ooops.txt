Ooops - alright
I'll come over
And pour myself over you
Jars of fun!
Exciting stories
I'll make you forget

Tickle you a little bit
Seduce out your good temper
I'll shine all over
I'll cook my best dish for you

But then it's my turn
I want all your adoration

Dog, I own you
Sit down fool
You own me
I'm yours
I'm the sun
I'll shine all over you
Grab the rays
Sugar

Ooops...alright
I'll come over
And pour myself over you
Jars of fun!
Exciting stories
I'll make you forget
I'll make you forget
