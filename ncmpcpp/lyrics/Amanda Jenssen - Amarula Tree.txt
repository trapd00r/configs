I don't need no money, mommy 
I don't have a lover, brother 
I keep away from the Juppies Puppy 
I just want my amarula tree  

Oh, it moves me without a touch 
People say that I think too much 
But I'm as happy as I can be 
Hanging by my amarula tree 

I'm a dreamer and I dream of what will be 
A better destiny 
I'm a dreamer and as far as I can see, Amarula trees
So I'm a dreamer and I dream of what will be
A better world for you and me, ohh

I don't look back I look beyond 
I'm just a struggling vagabond 
But I get by well on my own 
Where you are is what I call home

Whow, it moves me without a touch 
People say that I drink too much
But I'm as happy as I can be 
Hanging by my amarula tree  

I'm a dreamer and I dream of what will be
A better destiny
I'm a dreamer and as far as I can see, Amarula trees
I'm a dreamer and I dream of what will be
A better world for you and me
