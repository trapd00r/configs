Sitting up, late at night 
I tiptoe through the darkness 
Cold as hell, black as spades 
Aware of my immediate surrounding 
In my place I escape up into my hideout 
Hiding from everyone 
My friends all say, 
"Dave you're mental anyway" hey! 
Drift into a deeper state 
I stalk the cobwebbed stairways 
Dirt grits between my feet 
The stair creaks, I precariously sneak 
Hypnosis guides my hand 
I slipside through the walkways 
Sit in granny's rockin' chair 
Memories are whirling by, yeah 
Reminisce in the attic 
Lucretia waits impatiently 
Cobwebs make me squint 
The cobra so eloquently glints 
Moonbeams surge through the sky 
The crystal ball's energized 
Surely that like the cat waiting 
Lucretia rocks away
