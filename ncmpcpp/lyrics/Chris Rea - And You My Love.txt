And you my love


I do not sleep tonight
I may not ever
The sins of the past have come
See how they sit down together

Outside my window
Outside my door
And I know the reason what they've all come here for
You my love
My sweet, sweet love
Are what it's all because of

Surrender is easy
I know you do me no harm
But your innocence haunts me
The most fatal of charms

Oh I must have done some wrong
On a dark and distant day
For I know full and well tonight
This is how that I must pay

And you my love
My sweet, sweet love
Are what it's all because of
You my love
My sweet, sweet love
Are what it's all because of
