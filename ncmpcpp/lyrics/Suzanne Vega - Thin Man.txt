Music & Lyrics by Suzanne Vega 

He is not my friend, but he is with me
Like a shadow is with a foot that falls
His hand is on my back when I step from the sidewalk
Or when I'm walking down these darkened halls


He's the Thin Man
With a date for me
To arrive at some point
I don't know when it will be


I can feel his eyes when I don't expect him
In the back seat of a taxi down Vestry Street
His arm is around my waist and he pulls me down to him
He whispers things into my ear that sound so sweet


He's the Thin Man
With a date for me
To arrive at some point
I don't know when it will be


He is not my friend, but he is with me
And he promises a peace I never knew
I cannot give in, no, I must refuse him
But could I really be the one to resist that kiss so true


He's the Thin Man
With a date for me
To arrive at some point
I don't know when it will be
