I don't figure this rap shit out 
I map shit out strategically
Timing is everything and it seems to be the key 
Let 'em diss you first 
And respond immediatly 
In order to master the art of war 
Don't start a war 
Shit not no more 
We done scared 'em off there are no more 
Victims are sick 
I'm fixing to pick some to start shit 
Ain't got no pictures to rip 
And shit to throw darts at 
Ain't got no more targets 
Shit Irv and Jeff 
We done beat 'em to death 
Benzino in debt 
There just seems to just be no one left to bully 
Bush is pussy 
Why the fuck you think his names Bush? 
Puss is bushy 
Ain't shit goin on 
Shit I've been getting so bored lately 
I'm thinkin' of doin some shit to get you to go and hate me again 
Tell the truth I like the shit better than 
Shit I could spit better 
I'm 'bout to kick that sick shit again 
Look.. the game just ain't the same 
It changes 
Shit Dre's quittin' 
Jay's quittin' 
Now it's just wanksta 
Just saying the same shit 
It's fake and its ancient 
It's making me so bored I'mma just make a new language 
Fubba you cubba cubba 
Ubba you ubba ooba 
You can sus susa my 
Bib dick tooa tooba 
Some of the humane kinda' Llama[?]
I'm not a human I'm a suicidal 
Supersonic 
Suicidal 
Unibomber 
You think I'mma do Osama
Presidama - do Madona 
Jeffry on the leven with his legacy to carry on 
A lotta' talk of rumors on us who's the hottest to be honest 
Hip hop just ain't been the same 
Since Tupac moved to Cuba on us
