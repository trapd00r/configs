Beatles Like Dreamers do Lyrics:

I I saw a girl in my dreams
And so it seems
That I will love her.
Oh you, you are that girl
In my dreams
And so it seems
That I will love you.

And IIII waited for your kiss,
Waited for the bliss
Like dreamers do.

And I I I I,
Oh I'll be there, yeah
Waiting for you you you you you.
You, you came just one dream ago
And now I know that I
will love you.

I knew when you first said hello
That's how I know
That I will love you.
And I I I waited for your kiss,
Waited for the bliss
Like dreamers do.

And I I I I,
Oh I'll be there, yeah,
Waiting for you you you you you.
You, you came just one dream ago
And now I know that I
will love you.

Oh I knew when you
first said hello
That's how I know
That I will love you.

And I waited for your kiss,
Waited for the bliss
Like dreamers do,
Oh like dreamers do,
Like dreamers do.
