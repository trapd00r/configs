Lately I'm so tired
If I took it all out on you
I never meant to
If I left you outside
If you ever felt I ignored you
No, my life is all you

So put your best dress on
And wrap yourself in the arms of someone
Who wants to give you all the love you want

Tonight I gonna make it up to you
Tonight I'm gonna make love to you
Tonight you're gonna know how much I miss you, baby
Tonight I dedicate my heart to you
Tonight I gonna be a part of you
Tonight you're gonna know how much I miss you
And I miss you so

I don't wanna act like
I know that you'd be mine forever
Though I hope it's forever
Don't want you to feel like
I take you for granted
Whenever we are together

So put your best dress on
And wrap yourself in the arms of someone
Who wants to give you all the love you want

Tonight I dedicate my heart to you
Tonight I gonna be a part of you
Tonight you're gonna know how much I miss you, and I miss you
Tonight everytime I see your face
Tonight watching all over the place
Tonight, oh yeah, you're gonna know how much I miss you

So put your best dress on
And wrap yourself in my arms of my love

Tonight I gonna make it up to you
Tonight I'm gonna make love to you
Tonight you're gonna know how much I miss you, baby
Tonight I dedicate my heart to you
Tonight I gonna be a part of you
Tonight you're gonna know how much I miss you, baby 

Tonight I gonna make it up to you
Tonight I'm gonna make love to you
Tonight you're gonna know how much I miss you, baby
Tonight I dedicate my heart to you
Tonight I gonna be a part of you
Tonight you're gonna know how much I miss you
And I miss you so
