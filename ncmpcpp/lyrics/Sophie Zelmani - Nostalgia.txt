She was my best friend
She was my best friend
We won't reach up again
We broke all our plans

You've got a face, a soul, a name
but if you stay we both will go insane
Nostalgia

We can't talk about old days everytime our children'll play
What kind of memories becomes of such a melancholy day

You've got a face, a soul, a name
but if you stay we both will go insane
Nostalgia, you're just good for one day

I tried to leave you many times I almost succeeded once
Dreams are coming one by one to ask me what I've done
Now I hear it in the wind when old news are coming in
She did so well without me but I wonder if she's free

You've got a face, a soul, a name
but if you stay we both will go insane
You've got a face, a soul, a name
but if you stay we both will go insane
Nostalgia, you're just good for one day
Nostalgia, you're just good for one day
