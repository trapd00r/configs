Keep an eye out for your soul, girl
Don't let them devils take it away
All that glitters is not gold, girl
Hollywood is a dangerous place to play

Keep an out for your soul, girl
Cause ain't nothing getting rid of the stain
The hills are dark, the hills are cold, girl
They're soaked in blood, they're draped in pain

[Verse 1: Ill Bill]

Her heels clicking on the black asphalt
Her beauty's a pistol and a passport
I couldn't tell her nothin, look what her titties and her ass bought
You never asked what that cost, tell her that she can't afford it
Next thing you know she gotta have it, she can't avoid it
Champagne dreams, caviar wishes
Barely eighteen with bad intentions
Baby take heed, don't just laugh
And stress the fact I'm in the music business
Accuse me of using bitches
You're probably right, that guarantees it's the truth I'm spittin'
Trust nobody, question everything
The only thing certain is death eventually
And how perception is received
Deception is conceived, sex, drugs, decadence, and greed
You're my daughter, I raised you to be a queen
It seems like it was just yesterday you were born
I take responsibility for putting you onto the truth
To the devils and the gods it doesn't matter if you live in the rain
You can't wash it out cause nothing gets rid of the stain

[Chorus]

Keep an eye out for your soul, girl
Don't let the devils take it away
Hills are dark here, hills are cold girl
It's soaked in blood, they're draped in pain

Keep an eye out for your soul, girl
Don't let the devils take it away
All that glitters is not gold, girl
Hollywood is a dangerous place to play

[Verse 2: Slaine]

The hills have eyes in the land of lost angels in skies
The lies are disguised leaving truth tangled and tied
The fiends are awake, the lights are bright, the strangers are high
Dreams are at stake, there's no brakes on a dangerous ride
First you love it and you want it, go faster cause it's a rush
Hit the gas, try to chase cause you want it but you can't touch
The more that you speed and try to catch the further you fall
You scream for help and it seems nobody heard you at all
Baby, I don't want to see you repeat it and try to be me
Believing all the bullshit that they feed you on the TV
You're my seed and I was tortured, I need you to believe me
I rose from the city, fell into the seedy side of greedy
It's a letter from your daddy if I'm gone when you hear it
Just a memory, a voice on a record, even a spirit
Just remember it don't matter if you live in the rain
And try to wash it out, nothing gets rid of the stain

[Chorus]

Keep an eye out for your soul, girl
Don't let them devils take it away
All that glitters is not gold, girl
Hollywood is a dangerous place to play

Keep an out for your soul, girl
Cause ain't nothing getting rid of the stain
The hills are dark, the hills are old, girl
They're soaked in blood, they're draped in pain
