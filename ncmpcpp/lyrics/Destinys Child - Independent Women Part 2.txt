What you think about a girl like me?
Buy my own car and spend my own money
Only ring your celly when I'm feeling lonely
When it's all over please get up and leave

Please don't call me baby
Cause I'll call you
Don't mean to hurt you feelings, got a lot to do
Cause I am my number one priority
No falling in love, no commitment from me

All my independent women
Throw them hands up at me
And all my sexy women
Throw them hands up at me

All my money making women
Throw them hands up at me
All my baller women
Throw them hands up at me

Where my homegirls?
Where my females?
