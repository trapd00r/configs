Love me or leave me, 
make your choice but believe me
I love you
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

I can't conceal it, 
don't you see, cant you feel it?
Don't you too?
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

Oh, I've been dreaming through my lonely past
Now I just made it, I found you at last

So come on, now let's try it, 
I love you, can't deny it
cos its true
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

Oh, no hard feelings between you and me
If we cant make it, but just wait and see

So come on, now lets try it, 
I love you, can't deny it
cos its true
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

So love me or leave me, 
make your choice but believe me
I love you
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

I can't conceal it, 
don't you see, can't you feel it?
Don't you too?
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
