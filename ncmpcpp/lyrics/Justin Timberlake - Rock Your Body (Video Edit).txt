Don't be so quick to walk away
Dance with me
I wanna rock your body, please stay
Dance with me
You don't have to admit you, wanna play
Dance with me
Just let me rock you, 'til the break of day
Dance with me

Got time, but I don't mind
Just wanna rock you girl
I'll have whatever you have
Come on, let's give it a whirl
See I've been watching you
I like the way you move
So go ahead and girl just do
That ass thing you do

So you grab your girls
And you grab a couple more
And you all come meet me
In the middle of the floor
Said the air is thick, it's smelling right
So you pass to the left then you sail to the right

Don't be so quick to walk away
Dance with me
I wanna rock your body, please stay
Dance with me
You don't have to admit you, wanna play
Dance with me
Just let me rock you, 'til the break of day
Dance with me

I don't mean no harm
Just wanna rock you girl
You can move, but be calm
Let's go, let's give it a whirl
See it appears to me
You like the way I move
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
Pull you close and share my groove

So you grab your girls
And you grab a couple more
And you all can meet me
In the middle of the floor
Said the air is thick, it's smelling right
So you pass to the left then you sail to the right

Don't be so quick to walk away
Dance with me
I wanna rock your body, please stay
Dance with me
You don't have to admit you wanna play
Dance with me
Just let me rock you
Till the break of day
Dance with me

Talk to me boy
No disrespect, I don't mean no harm
Talk to me boy
But I can't wait to have you in my arms
Talk to me boy
Hurry up 'cause you're taking too long
Talk to me boy
Bet I'll have you naked by the end of this song

So what did you come for?
I came to dance with you
And you know that you don't wanna hit the floor
Need some romance with you
You're searching for love forever more
And I'll take a chance
If love is here on the floor, girl

Hey
Dance with me
Yeah
Come on baby

Don't be so quick to walk away
Don't walk away
Come on and
Dance with me
I wanna rock your body
Let me rock your body
Please stay
Come on and
Dance with me
You don't have to admit you wanna play
You don't have to admit you wanna play, just Dance with me
Just let me rock you
Do do do do
Till the break of day
Come on and
Dance with me

Talk to me boy
No disrespect, I don't mean no harm
Talk to me boy
But I can't wait to have you in my arms
Talk to me boy
Hurry up cause you're taking too long
Come on baby
Talk to me boy 
Bet I'll have you naked by the end of this song

Don't be so quick to walk away
Just thinking me and you
Don't be so quick to walk away
We could do something
Don't be so quick to walk away
I like the way you look right now
Don't be so quick to walk away
Come over here baby

Are you feeling me?
Let's do something
Let's make a bet
Cause I, bet I'll have you naked by the end of this song
