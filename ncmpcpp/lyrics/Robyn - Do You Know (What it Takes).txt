Always be around

(Do ya
Do ya
Do ya)

Don't you know I can see what you're doing?
Running around with your cheap talk, cheap talk, yeah
What I need is a man who can do me right, do me right

If you got what I need, I can guarantee
To return all the love that you've given to me
But I've got to be sure that you always will be around
(Always be around)

Do you know what it takes to love me?
Do you know what it takes to do me right?
Do you know what it takes to love me, baby, ba-by

Heaven knows in my time I've been lonely
Feeling my love echo in my mind, in my mind, yeah
A never satisfied girl's what they call me
But I just can't keep goin' on livin' lies

Guarantee unto me
You won't let me down
There's so much I can give
But it's buried so deep
I've just got to be sure that you always will be around
(Always be around)

Do you know what it takes to love me? (Do you know)
Do you know what it takes to do me right?
Do you know what it takes to love me baby, ba-by
Do you know what it takes? (Do you know)
Do you know what it takes?

(Don't waste my time, with your lies)
Yeah baby, I gotta know
(You've got to prove that you will always be around)

I'll give you everything
Boy, will you do the same for me?
Will you do anything?
I gotta know the way it'll be

Do you know what it takes to love me? (Do you know)
Do you know what it takes to do me right?
Do you know, do you know, do you know what it takes?
Do you know what it takes to love me, baby, yeah
Do you know what it takes to do me ri-ight?
Don't waste my time baby
