Ooh, stop the press
Girl you turn me on
And I wonder
If I could take you home
I must confess
The tight mini-skirt you wear
I just can't help it baby
I can't help but stare
So
Tell the dj
To pump it up a little more
Hey girl
I gotta let you know
That you've got that vibe

Repeat chorus

It's one o'clock
And the party's just beginning
The place is jumping
Ooh what a lovely scene
Gotta let you know
Let you know the deal
I want you now baby
And I'm for real
So
Tell the dj
To pump it up a little more
Now baby
I gotta let you know that
You've got that vibe

Repeat chorus

Yeah
How would you like to get
A piece of this pie
- You could be my girl
And I could be your guy
Yeah cuddle me in your arms
Like I'm your teddy bear
There isn't that nice
You'll have no fear yo
- Kiss me you fool
And make me melt like butter
When it comes to sayin' I love you
I won't st-st-st-stuttter
I'll turn you on like a neon light
Make everything alright
Like in the middle of the night
Yo when you need somebody to love you
- Yeah

Kiss and caress you and hold you
And my word is born
Yo P. A
