It's Britney, bitch
I see you, and I just wanna dance with you

*Giggles*

Every time they turn the lights down
Just wanna go that extra mile for you (you, you)
Public display of affection (ooh)
Feels like no one else in the room (but you)

We can get down like there's no one around
We keep on rocking (we keep on rocking)
We keep on rocking (keep on rocking)
Cameras are flashing while we're dirty dancing
They keep watchin' (they keep watchin')
Keep watching, feels like the crowd is saying

Gimme gimme more

Gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more

Gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more

A center of attention (do you feel that?)
Even when we're up against the wall
You got me in a crazy position (yeah)
If you're on a mission (uh huh)
You got my permission now

We can get down like there's no one around
We keep on rocking (keep on rocking)
We keep on rocking, rocking (oh, uh huh)
Cameras are flashing while we're dirty dancing
They keep watchin' (they keep watching)
Keep watching, feels like the crowd is saying
