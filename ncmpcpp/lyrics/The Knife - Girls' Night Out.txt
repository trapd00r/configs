We were looking for a room
We were looking for a hotel
We were in between
We were a few chosen
Somewhere to fit in
Something that's fitting
After one day it started itching
And we rubbed until it was bleeding

And we laughed at the moonlight far beyond
And we ran through the moonlight far beyond

We were looking for something to blow up
We were looking for something to follow
We had one way out
We had some hours left
We were so close
We knew we were chosen
We aimed for high speed
And for someone who could catch me

And we laughed at the moonlight far beyond
And we ran through the moonlight far beyond

We were looking for a room
We were looking for something to blow up
We knew we were chosen

And we laughed at the moonlight far beyond
And we ran through the moonlight far beyond
(repeat)
