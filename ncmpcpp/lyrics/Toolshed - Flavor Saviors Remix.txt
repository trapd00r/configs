I'm an ocean in your bedroom 
Make you feel warm 
Make you want to re-assume 
Now we know it all for sure 

I'm a dance hall dirty breakbeat 
Make the snow fall 
Up from underneath your feet 
Not alone, I'll be there 
Tell me when you want to go 

I'm a meth lab first rehab 
Take it all off 
And step inside the running cab 
There's a love that knows the way 

I'm the rainbow in your jail cell 
All the memories of 
Everything you've ever smelled 
Not alone, I'll be there 
Tell me when you want to go 

Sideways falling 
More will be revealed my friend 
Don't forget me 
I can't hide it 
Come again make me excited 

I'm an inbred and a pothead 
Two legs that you spread 
Inside the tool shed 
Now we know it all for sure 

I could show you 
To the free field 
Overcome and more 
Will always be revealed 
Not alone, I'll be there 
Tell me when you want to go 

Sideways falling 
More will be revealed my friend 
Don't forget me 
I can't hide it 
Come again get me excited 

I'm the bloodstain 
On your shirt sleeve 
Coming down and more are coming to believe 
Now we know it all for sure 

Make the hair stand 
Up on your arm 
Teach you how to dance 
Inside the funny farm 
Not alone, I'll be there 
Tell me when you want to go
