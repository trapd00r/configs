I believe in you and me
I believe that we will be
In love eternally

Well as far as I can see
You will always be the one
For me
Oh yes you will ,boy

And I believe in dreams again
I believe that love will never end
And like the river finds the sea
I was lost, now I'm free
'Cause I believe in you and me

I will never leave your side
I will never hurt your pride
When all the chips are down baby
See now I'll always be around
Just to be right where you are
My love, you know I love you boy

I will never leave you out
I will always let you in boy, oh baby
To places no one's ever been
Deep inside, can't you see
That I believe in you and me

Maybe I'm a fool
To feel the way I do
I will play the fool forever
Just to be with you forever

I believe in miracles
And love's a miracle
And yes, baby you're my dream come true

I was lost, now I'm free
Oh baby 'cause I believe, I do 
Believe in you and me
See I was lost, now I'm free
'Cause I believe in you and me

Believe in you and me
