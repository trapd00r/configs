There goes the siren that warns of the air raid, 
There comes the sound of the guns sending flak! 
Out for the scramble, we've got to get airborne, 
Got to get up for the coming attack! 

Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines.
Remove all the wheel-blocks, there's no time to waste!
Gathering speed as we head down the runway, 
Got to get airborne before it's too late! 

Running, scrambling, flying... 
Rolling, turning, diving, going in again. 
Running, scrambling, flying... 
Rolling, turning, diving. 

Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die. 
Won't you run, live to fly, fly to live, Aces high?

Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers, 
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away. 
Roll over, spin round, to come in behind them; 
Move to their blindsides and firing again. 

Bandits at 8 o'clock move in behind us,
Ten ME-109's out of the sun. 
Ascending and turning our spitfires to face them; 
Heading straight for them, I press down my guns. 

Rolling, turning, diving... 
Rolling, turning, diving (doing it again).
Rolling, turning, diving...
Rolling, turning, diving. 

Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die. 
Won't you run, live to fly, fly to live, Aces high?
