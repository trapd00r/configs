Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper 
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter 

I can't help falling in love 
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go 
Kisses sent from heaven above 
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know 

When you know the notes to sing 
You can sing most anything 
That's what my mama told me 
Round and round and round you go 
When you find love you'll always know 
I let my father mold me

Daddy couldn't be all wrong 
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)
And my mama made me learn this song 
(You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you)
That's why 

I can't help falling in love 
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go 
Kisses sent from heaven above 
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

The deeper I go 
All is fair in love she said 
Think with your heart, not with your head 
That's what my mama told me 
All the little things you do 
Will end up coming back to you 
I let my father mold me 

Daddy couldn't be all wrong 
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)
And my mama made me learn this song 
(You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you)
That's why

I can't help falling in love 
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go 
Kisses sent from heaven above 
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

I can't help falling in love 
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go 
Kisses sent from heaven above 
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

Someone said that romance was dead 
And I believed it instead of remembering 
What my mama told me 
Let my father mold me 
Then you tried to hold me

You remind me what they said 
This feeling inside 
I can't explain 
But my love is alive 
And I'm never gonna hide it again 

Daddy couldn't be all wrong 
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)
And my mama made me learn this song 
(You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you)
That's why

I can't help falling in love 
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go 
Kisses sent from heaven above 
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper 
Never gonna hide it again 
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter 
Never gonna have to pretend

Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper 
Never gonna hide it again 
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter 
Never gonna have to pretend

You got to just let your body move to the music 
You got to just let your body go with the flow 
Falling in love, falling in love, falling in love 
I can't keep from falling in love with you 
You know there's nothing better that I'd like to do
