Oh, Lilian
Look what you’ve done 
You’ve stripped my heart 
Ripped it apart 
In the name of fun 

Oh, Lilian
I’m a poor man’s son 
And precious jewels 
Weren’t found in schools 
Where I came from 

Pain and misery 
Always hit the spot 
Knowing you can’t lose 
What you haven’t got 

Oh, Lilian
I should have run 
I should have known 
Each dress you own 
Is a loaded gun 

Oh, Lilian

Oh, Lilian
I need protection 
I hear your voice 
And any choice 
I had is gone 

Oh, Lilian
Once I'd begun 
I couldn’t stop 
Till every drop 
Of blood was sung 
Pain and misery 
Always hit the spot 
Knowing you can’t lose 
What you haven’t got 

Oh, Lilian
Look what you’ve done 
You've stripped my heart 
Ripped it apart 
In the name of fun 

Oh, Lilian...
