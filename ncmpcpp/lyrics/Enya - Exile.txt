Cold as the northern winds 
In December mornings, 
Cold is the cry that rings 
From this far distant shore. 
Winter has come too late 
Too close beside me. 
How can I chase away 
All these fears deep inside? 

I'll wait the signs to come. 
I'll find a way 
I will wait the time to come. 
I'll find a way home. 
My light shall be the moon 
And my path - the ocean. 
My guide the morning star 
As I sail home to you. 

I'll wait the signs to come. 
I'll find a way 
I will wait the time to come. 
I'll find a way home. 
My light shall be the moon 
And my path - the ocean. 
My guide the morning star 
As I sail home to you. 

Who then can warm my soul? 
Who can quell my passion? 
Out of these dreams - a boat 
I will sail home to you.
