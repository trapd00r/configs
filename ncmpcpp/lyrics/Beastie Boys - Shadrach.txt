Riddle me this brother can you handle it 
Your style to my style you can't hold a candle to it 
Equinox symmetry and the balance is right 
Smokin' and drinkin' on a Tuesday night 
It's not how you play the game it's how you win it 
I cheat and steal and sin and I'm a cynic 
For those about to rock we salute you 
The dirty thoughts for dirty minds we contribute to 

I once was lost but now I'm found 
The music washes over and you're one with the sound 
Who shall inherit the earth the meek shall 
I think I'm starting to peak now Al 
From S.S. Decontrol and the man upstairs I hope that he cares 
If I had a penny for my thoughts I'd be a millionaire 
We're just three M.C.'s and we're on the go 
Sharach...Mesach...Abednago (Sharach...Mesach...Abednago) 

Only twenty four hours in a day 
Only twelve notes a man can play 
Music for all and not just one people 
And now we're gonna bust with the Putney Swope sequel 
More Adidas sneakers that a plumber got pliers 
Got more suites that Jacoby & Meyers 
If not for my vices my bugged out desires 
My year would be good just like Goodyear's tires 
So I'm out pickin' pockets at the Atlantic Antic 
And nobody wants to hear you cause your rhymes are so frantic 
I mix business with pleasure way too much 
I mean wine and women and song and such 
I don't get blue I gotta mean red streak 
You don't pay the band your friends and that's weak 
Get even like Steven like pulling a Rambo 
Sharach...Mesach...Abednago (Sharach...Mesach...Abednago) 
 
Steal from the rich and I'm out robbing banks 
Give to the poor and I always give thanks 
Got more stories that J.D. Salinger 
I hold the title and you are the challenger 
I've got money like Charles Dickens 
Got the girlies in the Couple like the Colonel's got the chickens 
Always go out dapper like Harry S. Truman 
I'm madder than Mad's Alfred E. Newman 
(Never gonna let them say that I don't love you) 
My noggin is hoggin' all kinds of thoughts 
Adam Yoggin is Yauch and he's rockin' of course 
Smoke the holy chalice got my own religion 
Rally round the stage and check the funky dope musicians 
Jerry Lee Swaggert or Jerry Lee Falwell 
You love Mario Andretti cause he always drives his car well 

Vicious circle of reality since the day you were born 
And we love the hot butter on what the popcorn 
Sippin on wine and mackin'
Rockin on the stage with all the hands clappin' 
Ride the wave of fate it don't ride me 
(Being very proud to be an M.C.) 
And the man upstairs I hope that he cares If I had a penny for my 
Thoughts I'd be a millionaire 
Amps and crossovers under my rear hood 
The bass is bumpin' from the back of my Fleetwood Brougham D'Elegance 
They tell us what to do hell no 
Sharach...Mesach...Abednago (Sharach...Mesach...Abednago)
