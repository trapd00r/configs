No sleep, no sex for you from your ex-girlfriend
I was too deep can't let you call me just jump in
At times I would push my feelings aside to let you feel
I'm novocaine I'm numb and nothing's real

Like the coldest winter
I am frozen from you

I was weak before now you've made me
So numb I can't feel much for you anymore
I gave you my all my baby
I'm numb, numb, numb

But the tears were silent inside, you see
But the tears were silent inside, you see

I laid there quiet
And watched you have your way with me
I might have cried 
But the tears were silent inside, you see

You called me names
Made me feel like I was dumb
I didn't feel a thing
And now I'm gone, gone, gone

Like a battered child
I got used to your pain but you know it's 'cause  

I was weak before now you've made me
So numb I can't feel much for you anymore
I gave you my all my baby
I'm numb, numb, numb (x4)
