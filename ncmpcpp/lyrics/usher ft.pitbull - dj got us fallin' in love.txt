Usher
Usher (yeah man)

So we back in the club
With our bodies rockin' from side to side.
Side, side to side
Thank God the week is done
I feel like a zombie gone back to life,
Back, back to life
Hands up and suddenly, we all got our hands up.
No control of my body.
Ain’t I seen you before?
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes.
Eyes, eyes, eyes...

'Cause baby tonight,
The DJ got us fallin' in love again
Yeah, baby tonight,
The DJ got us fallin' in love again
So dance, dance, like it’s the last,
Last night of your life, life
Gonna get you right
'Cause baby tonight,
The DJ got us fallin' in love again.

Keep downin' drinks like there's no tomorrow
There's just right now, now, now,
Now, now, now, now
Gon' set the roof on fire
Gonna burn this mutha down, down, down,
Down, down, down, down (Come on)
Hands up, when the music drops
We both put our hands up
Put your hands on my body
Swear I seen you before
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes
Eyes, eyes, eyes.

'Cause baby tonight,
The DJ got us fallin' in love again
Yeah, baby tonight,
The DJ got us fallin' in love again (love again)
So dance, dance, like it’s the last
Last night of your life, life
Gon' get you right
'Cause baby tonight
The DJ got us fallin' in love again.

[Pitbull]
Usher, don't lie
Hear no evil, or speak no evil, or see no evil
Get it, baby, hope you catch it like T.O., that's how we roll
My life is a movie, and you just Tivo

Miami got me swishin' like a dreadlock
She don't wrestle, but I got her in a headlock
Yabba dabba doo, make her bed rock
Miami on fire, pss, red hot

Bada bing, bada boom
Mr. Worldwide as I step in the room
I'm a hustler, baby, but that you knew
And tonight it's just me and you, dale

[Usher]
'Cause baby tonight,
The DJ got us fallin' in love again
(Mr. Worldwide, yeah, let's take over the world)
Yeah, baby tonight, (yeah man)
The DJ got us fallin' in love, let go (dale)
Fallin' in love, oh, whoa
So dance, dance, like it’s the last
Last night of your life, life
Gonna get you right.

'Cause baby tonight (c'mon, c'mon)
The DJ got us fallin' in love again
Yeah, baby tonight
The DJ got us fallin' in love again
So dance, dance, like it’s the last
Last night of your life, life
Gonna get you right
'Cause baby tonight
The DJ got us fallin' in love again. (love again)

[Spoken:]
Yeah, thank you DJ. [laugh]
