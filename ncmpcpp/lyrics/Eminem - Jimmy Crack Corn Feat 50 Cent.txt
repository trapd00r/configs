[50 Cent:] 
Man, let's go 
[Eminem:] 
Ayo fif' 
[50 Cent:] 
Yeah 
[Eminem:] 
Come on en tell 'em 
It's time to hate us again 
We're back 
[50 Cent:] 
haha 

[Verse 1: Eminem] 
Jimmy can Crack Corn, but I don't care 
My enemies Crack Corn, but I don't care 
You can be black, white or albino, yeah 
You can have corn rows inside your hair 
I give a fuck if I don't like your stair 
This bottle of wine goes upside your head 
A little bit psycho, but I know that 
Think we just don't say it, then I won't say it 
See if you don't brag, then I don't brag 
I know I'm bad, as long as I know I'm bad 
I don't need y'all to co-sign no shit 
You can just keep makin' them tired old threads 
A little bit like the boy you cried wolf, yeah 
See me, but don't dare to try no shit 
Cause you know that somewhere inside those layers 
A rattlesnake's right there to bite your ass 
And I can be so quiet and strike so fast 
Like lightning bolts right out the sky go bad 
From outta nowhere, you might find your career 
Come to it,... and I was like (Oh Yeah) 

[Chorus:]
See us come to award shows we're like (Oh yeah) 
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah) 
See us keep blowin' up, we're like (Oh yeah) 
See Jimmy can Crack Corn but I don't care 
See me in your videos, I'm like (Oh yeah) 
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em) 
And where is D12 at, they're like (We over here) 
And where the fuck we goin, well like (No where) 

[Verse 2: Eminem] 
Jealous little fucks beg for my attention but 
I done told you once, I'm not the kind of attention you want 
If I tell you twice, then I won't be so nice 
If you keep comin' back, it only means you know you lost a fight 
They wanna talk shit, let 'em talk shit, cause they talk shit 
Knowin' deep down, they really just wanna squase it 
Cause no one wants to walk around, steppin' in dog shit 
And get doo-doo on the shoe again, soon as they washed it 
But the pride won't let 'em, inside's a 'Go get 'em' 
And I'm just like 'Why your tryna fight momentum?' 
We just keep winnin', by landslides oh en umm 
Shady Limited's, in any size yo' Denim 
To velour, even our clothing line's on fire 
As 50 would say 'Our clothing line's on Fiyaa'' 
We ain't wire your minds on us, like mine's on Mariah 
And y'all is just like her, you're all fucking liars 
But I just keep fucking you, like I fucked her 
Right in the ass with KY, Yes sir! 
So full of joy, why am I absurd 
Even Chingy would tell you 
'Yea boi don't curr' 

[Chorus:]
See us come to award shows we're like (Oh yeah) 
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah) 
See us keep blowin' up, we're like (Oh yeah) 
See Jimmy can Crack Corn but I don't care 
See me in your videos, I'm like (Oh yeah) 
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em) 
And where is G-Unit at, they're like (We over here) 
And where the fuck we goin, well like (No where) 

[Verse 3: 50 Cent] 
Ya homie got clapped on, man I don't care 
The cops in my Nana crib, but I'm not there 
It is what it is dawg, man life's not fair 
Ya friends shoulda know not to front 'round here 
You see kid, where I'm from, the wolves smell fear 
They'll strip yo ass, of your jewels, right here 
Man and I'ma say this one time, now get this clear 
Man you can catch a hot one like outta no where 
A beautiful day, without drama is rare 
Ya girl's a freak, man sometime we share 
Yeah, I wear a condom and you go bare 
You prolly heard about me, I'm a shown up playa 
In the hood politicin', like I'm runnin' for mayor 
ridin', winding, dining and shining, know what I'm sayin 
I ain't got time for fucking around, and horseplayin' 
I'm making hits, my homies takin' hits, who's staying 

[Chorus:]
See us come to award shows we're like (Oh yeah) 
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah) 
See us keep blowin' up, we're like (Oh yeah) 
See Jimmy can Crack Corn but I don't care 
See me in your videos, I'm like (Oh yeah) 
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em) 
And where is D12 at, they're like (We over here) 
And where the fuck we goin, well like (No where)
