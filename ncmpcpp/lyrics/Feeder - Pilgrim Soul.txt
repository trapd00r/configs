You said, you could, you would, you should
Nothing could be this good again
Nothing could beat this... nothing... nothing

Fracture and break falling from grace
Finding someone you trust, believe, elate, saved
Crawling, I'm Crawling...

Hanging on, there's only one way out
Pushing up, here's only one way now
'Cause hey life's for living
So don't you give in, don't you tear it apart

All that you face, you lose, abuse
Carry the cross, the faith, the loss, the weight, the bruise
Falling, I'm falling...

Moving around a town, a space
Climbing a wall, a tower, a tree a higher place
Calling, I'm calling...

Hanging on, there's only one way out
Pushing up, there's only one way now
'Cause hey, life's for living
So don't you give in, don't you tear it apart, yeah
Hey life's forgiving
So don't you give in, don't you tear it apart, yeah

You said, you could, you would, you should
Nothing could be this good again
Nothing could beat this... nothing... nothing

Finding the strength, the sense, amend
Purpose, a sun, a moon, a light, a love, a friend
Something (x2)
Hanging on, there's only one way out
Pushing up, there's only one way now

'Cause hey life's for for living, so don't you give in
Don't you tear it apart... yeah
Hey, life's for giving, so don't you give in
Don't you tear it apart... yeah
