You know how us Catholic girls can be
We make up for so much time a little too late
I never forgot it, confusing as it was
No fun with no guilt feelings
The sinners, the saviors, the loverless priests
I'll see you next Sunday

We all had our reasons to be there
We all had a thing or two to learn
We all needed something to cling to
So we did 

I sang Alleluia in the choir
I confessed my darkest deeds to an envious man
My brothers they never went blind for what they did
But I may as well have   
In the name of the Father, the Skeptic and the Son
I had one more stupid question 

We all had our reasons to be there
We all had a thing or two to learn
We all needed something to cling to
So we did 

What I learned I rejected but I believe again
I will suffer the consequences of this inquisition
If I jump in this fountain, will I be forgiven 

We all had our reasons to be there
We all had a thing or two to learn
We all needed something to cling to
So we did 

We all had delusions in our head
We all had our minds made up for us
We had to believe in something
So we did
