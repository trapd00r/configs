I was born in a cross-fire hurricane 
And I howled at my ma in the driving rain, 
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas! 
But it's all right.  I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash, 
It's a Gas!  Gas!  Gas! 

I was raised by a toothless, bearded hag, 
I was schooled with a strap right across my back, 
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas! 
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash, 
It's a Gas!  Gas!  Gas! 

I was drowned, I was washed up and left for dead. 
I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled. 
I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread. 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
I was crowned with a spike right thru my head. 
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas! 
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash, 
It's a Gas!  Gas!  Gas! 

Jumping Jack Flash, its a gas 
Jumping Jack Flash, its a gas 
Jumping Jack Flash, its a gas 
Jumping Jack Flash, its a gas 
Jumping Jack Flash
