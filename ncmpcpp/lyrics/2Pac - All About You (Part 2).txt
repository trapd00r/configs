 [Down] I'ma say it's all about you baby, yeah 

 [2Pac] Haha, for the bitches that think it's all about you 

 It's all about you 

 [Down] This Dru Down in the house, with my boy 'Pizznac 

 YouknowhatI'msayin? 

 [2Pac] It's all about you 

 [Down] Yeah I'm gon' say it's all about you 

 but you know I'm lyin though, hah!  Yeauhh 

  

 [2Pac] 

 You probably crooked as the last trick; want it light 

 but how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch 

 Thinkin I had her but she had me in the long run 

 It's just my luck I'm stuck with fuckin with the wrong one, uh! 

 Wise decisions, based on lies we livin 

 Scandalous times, this game's like my religion 

 You could be rollin with a thug 

 Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin for some love 

 In every club, I see you starin like you want it 

 Well baby if you got it better flaunt it 

 Let the liquor help you get up on it 

 I'm still tipsy from last night 

 Bumpin these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life 

 I try to holla but you tell me you taken 

 Sayin you ain't impressed, with the money I'm makin 

 Guess it's true what they tellin me 

 Fresh out of jail, life's Hell for a black, celebrity 

 So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you widdit 

 Fantansies of us sweatin, can I hit it?  (Hahaha) 

 Addicted to the things you do, but still true 

 What I'm sayin Boo, is this is all about you 

  

 [Nate Dogg] 

 Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o 

 (It's all about you) 

 No matter where I go, I see the same hoe 

 (Yeah nigga, ha ha ha ha!) 

 Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o 

 (It's all about you) 

 No matter where I go, I see the same hoe 

  

 [2Pac] 

 I make a promise if you go with me, just let me know 

 I'll have you hollerin my name out before I leave 

 Nobody loves me I'm a thug nigga; I only hung out 

 with the criminals and the drug dealers, I love niggaz 

 cause we comin from the same place 

 Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick, the game takes 

 How can I tell her I'm a playa, and I don't even care 

 Creep though, weed smoke's into the air 

 Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes 

 waitin for niggaz at the end, of every show 

 I just seen you in my friend's, video 

 Could never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go 

 Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin through.. 

 It's all about you.. hahaha, yeah nigga! 

 It's all about you! 

  

 [Nate Dogg] 

 Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o 

 (It's all about you) 

 No matter where I go, I see the same hoe 

 Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o 

 (It's all about you) 

 No matter where I go, I see the same hoe 

  

 [Outlawz] 

 Is you sick from the dick, or is it the flu? 

 It ain't about you or your bitch ass crew 

 Every other city we go and every video 

 Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty hoe 

 You think it's all about you?  Well Boo 

 I gets Down like Dru and my nasty new niggaz, too 

  

 You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track 

 A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff 

 When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll 

 Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll 

 Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next 

 Golddiggin, cold diggin a gold Rolex 

  

 I slide in easily, try a grizzly 

 Sluts know the cuts, I came to fuck, try skeezin me 

 Runnin up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya 

 At the most, I fucked a bitch from the West Coast to West Virginia 

  

 [Nate Dogg] 

 Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o 

 (It's all about you) 

 No matter where I go, I see the same hoe 

 Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o 

 (It's all about you) 

 No matter where I go, I see the same hoe 

 Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o 

 (It's all about you) 

 No matter where I go, I see the same hoe 

 Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o 

 No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
