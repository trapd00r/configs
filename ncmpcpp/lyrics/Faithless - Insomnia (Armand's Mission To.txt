And here we are.
Half-past three in the morning;
I can't get no sleep.

Yeah.
Yeah.

I never sleep.
I never sleep.
I never sleep.
I never sleep.
I never sleep.

Yeah, I only smoke weed when I need to,
And I need to get some rest. Yo, where's the cess?
I confess, I burned a hole in the mattress,
Yes yes it was me, I plead guilty,
And at the count of three I pull back the duvet,
Make my way to the refrigerator,
One dry potato inside, no lie,
Not even bread, jam,
When the light above my head went bam.

I can't see, something's all over me,
Greasy. Insomnia; please release me,
And let me dream about making mad love on the heath,
Tearing off tights with my teeth,
But there's no relief,
I'm wide awake in my kitchen,
It's black and I'm lonely.
Oh if I could only get some sleep?
Creaky noises make my skin creep,
I need to get some sleep.
I can't get no sleep.
