People can take everything away from you 
But they can never take away your truth 
But the question is... 
Can you handle mine? 

They say I'm crazy 
I really don't care 
That's my prerogative 
They say I'm nasty 
But I don't give a damn 
Getting boys is how I live 
Some ask me questions 
Why am I so real? 
But they don't understand me 
I really don't know the deal about my sister 
Trying hard to make it right 
Not long ago 
Before I won this fight 

(Chorus:) 

Everybody's talking all this stuff about me 
Why don't they just let me live? 
I don't need permission, make my own decisions 
That's my prerogative 
that's my prerogative 
(it's my prerogative) 

It's the way that I wanna live (it's my prerogative) 
You can't tell me what to do 

Don't get me wrong 
I'm really not souped 
Ego trips is not my thing 
All these strange relationships really gets me down 
I see nothing wrong in spreading myself around 

Everybody's talking all this stuff about me 
Why don't they just let me live? 
I don't need permission, make my own decisions 
That's my prerogative 
That's my prerogative 

Everybody's talking all this stuff about me 
Why don't they just let me live? 
I don't need permission, make my own decisions 
That's my prerogative 
that's my prerogative 

It's the way that I wanna live (it's my prerogative) 
You can't tell me what to do 

why can't I live my life 
without all of the things 
That people say 
oh oh 

Everybody's talking all this stuff about me 
Why don't they just let me live? 
I don't need permission, make my own decisions 
That's my prerogative (they say I'm crazy) 

Everybody's talking all this stuff about me 
Why don't they just let me live? (they say I'm use to) 
I don't need permission, make my own decisions 
That's my prerogative 
(it's my prerogative)
