(Eminem) 
Sometimes I just feel like, quittin I still might 
Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write 
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin with real life 
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics 
And show these people what my level of skill's like 
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life 
Somethin ain't right, hit the brake lights 
Case of the stage fright, drawin a blank like 
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault 
Great big eye balls, my insides crawl 
and I clam up I just slam shut 
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's 
just been stripped, I've just been ripped 
So I must then get, what the bus didn't split
Man fuck this shit yo, I'm goin the fuck home 
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road 

(Chorus) 
I'm a man, Gotta make a new plan 
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land 
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands 
Once I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back 
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin 
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone 
Ain't gonna follow no footsteps, I'm makin my own 
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road 

(Eminem) 
I'm walkin these train tracks, tryin to regain back 
the spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap 
To the same plant, in the same pants 
Tryin to chase rap, gotta move ASAP 
And get a new plan, momma's got a new man 
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand 
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad 
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand 
While she colors her big brother, her mother and dad 
Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head 
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had 
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad! 
Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet 
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grown me two nuts yet 
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep 
The pressure's too much man, I'm just tryin to do what's best 
And I try, sit alone and I cry 
Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by 
That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin you God 
Please don't let me be pigeon-holed in no regular job 
Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are 
Yo I'm tellin you dawg I'm bailin this trailer tomorrow 
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye 
Say whenever you need me baby, I'm never too far 
But yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know 
And I'ma be back for you, the second that I blow 
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own 
Off to work I go, back to this 8 Mile Road 

(Chorus) 
I'm a man, Gotta make a new plan 
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land 
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands 
Once I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back 
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin 
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone 
Ain't gonna follow no footsteps, I'm makin my own 
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road 

(Eminem) 
You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get it 
Or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is 
To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits 
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate 
of authenticity, you'd never even see 
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility 
You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC 
who's incredible, up on the same pedestal as me 
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin a rough time 
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes 
Go to work and serve MCs in the lunchline 
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go 
Who must I show, to bust my flow 
Where must I go, who must I know 
Or am I just another crab in the bucket 
Cause I ain't havin no luck with this little Rabbit so fuck it 
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin to doubt shit 
I'm feelin a little skeptical who I hang out with 
I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit 
at the Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfit 
And it's cold, tryin to travel this road 
Plus I feel like I'm old, stuck in this battlin' mode 
My defenses are so up, and one thing I don't want 
is pity from no one, the city is no fun 
There is no sun, and it's so dark 
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein pulled apart 
from each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends 
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin 
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not 
what I'm doin I just blow, my head is a stove top 
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot 
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the gas that I don't got 
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn 
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned 
Ain't no fallin on next time I meet a new girl 
I can no longer play stupid or be immature 
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage 
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words 
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge 
Suddenly a new burst of energy is occured 
Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third 
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird 
Then I turn and cross over the median curb 
Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road 

(Chorus)
I'm a man, Gotta make a new plan 
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land 
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands 
Once I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back 
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin 
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone 
Ain't gonna follow no footsteps, I'm makin my own 
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road
