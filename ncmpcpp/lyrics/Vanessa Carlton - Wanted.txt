I have wandered, far and wide
for something real, some thing to die for
but I have found you, and you do not see
All that is me, all that is true

I am more than you will see,
I am more than you will need,
I am more than you will see,
More than wanted 

As you float the flimsy surface
You should know life lies beneath it
And don't pretend you feel what I feel
You live illusion and I'm real

I am more than you will see,
I am more than you will need, 
I am more than you will see,
More than wanted...

I know, I know
You like the way you feel
When I play

I know, I know
You don't really hear
What I say

I know, I know
You are waiting 
For something to raid

I know,  I know
You wish you could be
More than you say

I have wandered, far and wide
for something real, some thing to die for
but I have found you, and you do not see
All that is me, all that is true

I am more than you will see,
I am more than you will need, 
I am more than you will see,
More than wanted

I am more than you will see,
I am more than you will need, 
I am more than you will see,
More than wanted
More than you'll love
More than you'll hate
More than you'll hold
More than wanted
More than you'll crave
More than you'll cherish
More than you'll have
More than wanted.
