For whatever reason 
I feel like I've been wanting you all my life 
You don't understand 
I'm so glad we're at the same place at the same time 
It's over now 

I spotted you dancin'
You made all the girls stare 
Those lips and your brown eyes 
And your sexy hair 
I shake-shake my thing 
I make the world want you 
Tell your boys you'll be back 
I wanna see what you can do

Bridge-
What would it take for you to just leave with me (uh uh)
Not trying to sound conceited but me and you were meant to be (yeah yeah) 
You're a sexy guy, I'm a nice girl (don't you know?)
Lets turn this dance floor into our own little nasty world (Yeah..) 

Chorus-
(Boys) Sometimes a girl just needs one (Oh you know I need you)
(Boys) To love her and to hold (I just want you to touch me)
(Boys) And when a girl is with one (mm mm)
(Boys) Then she's in control (Yeah)

Get your boy off the dance floor 
Screamin' in his ear 
Must have said something about me (What'd you say?)
Cause he's looking over here (ooh...)
You're looking at me, with a sexy attitude
But the way that boys is moving it (Uh)
It puts me in the mood (ow!)

Bridge
What would it take for you to just leave with me
Not tryin to sound concieted but me and you were meant to be
Your a sexy guy, I'm a nice girl
Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty world

Chorus

Tonight, lets fly, boy have no fear
There's no time to lose
And next week you may not see me here, 
So boy just make your move

Chorus

Come with me
Let's fly into the night
Boy, tonight is ours (it's just me and you baby)
Keep loving me
Make sure you hold me tight
Let's head for the stars (Get nasty)

Chorus

Can't live with 'em, can't live with out 'em!
