Love me, love me
Say you do
Let me fly away with you

We are creatures of the wind
Wild is the wind

Give me more than one caress
Satisfy this hungriness

We are creatures of the wind
Wild is the wind

You touch me
I hear the sound of mandolins, baby
You kiss me...
With your kiss my life begins

Like a leaf clings to a tree
Baby, please cling to me

We are creatures of the wind
Wild is the wind

You touch me
I hear the sound of mandolins
And you kiss me
With your kiss my life begins..

Love me, love me
Say you do
Let me fly away with you
