 Wyclef Jean Featuring Mary J. Blige - 911
 ===========================================
 
 [Wyclef]
 Yo, what up, this Wyclef with Mary J.
 I serenade the girls with my accoustic guitar
 You know what I'm sayin'?
 Yo, fellas havin' problems with the chicks?
 I want you right now to turn the lights down low
 Pull your girl up next to you
 I want you to sing this to her
 
 If death comes for me tonight, girl
 I want you to know that I love you
 And no matter how tough I wouldn't dare
 Only to you I would reveal my tears
 So tell the police I ain't home tonight
 Messin' around with you is gonna get me life
 But when I look into your eyes
 You're worth that sacrafice
 If this is the kind of love that my mom used to warn me about
 Man, I'm in trouble
 I'm in real big trouble
 If this is the kind of love that the old folks used to warn me about
 Man, I'm in trouble
 I'm in real big trouble
 I need y'all to do me a favor
 
 Someone please call 911 (pick up the phone yo)
 Tell them I just been shot down
 and the bullet's, in my heart
 And it's piercin through my soul (I'm losin blood yo)
 Feel my body gettin cold
 Somone please call 911 (pick up the phone yo)
 The alleged assailaint, is five foot one
 and she shot me through my soul
 Feel my body gettin cold
 
 [Mary J. Blige]
 So cold
 Sometimes I feel like I'm a prisoner
 I think I'm trapped here for a while
 (but I'm always right here with you girl)
 And every breath I fight to take
 Is as hard as these four walls I wanna break
 I told the cops you wasn't here tonight
 Messin' around with me is gonna get you life
 Oh yeah, yeah
 But everytime I look into your eyes
 Then it's worth the sacrifice
 
 [Wyclef]
 If this is the kind of love that your mom used to warn you about
 Man, we are in trouble 
 You're in real big trouble 
 If this is the kind of love that the old folks used to warn me about 
 I'm in trouble 
 I'm in real big trouble
 You got anything to say, girl?
 
 [Mary J. Blige]
 Someone please call 911, yeah yeah (pick up the phone yo)
 Tell them I just got shot down
 And it's piercin through my soul (I'm losin blood yo)
 Feel my body gettin cold
 
 [Wyclef]
 Someone please call 911 (can you do that for me)
 The alleged assailaint, was five foot one
 And she shot me through my soul (and he shot me through my heart)
 Feel my body gettin cold
 (He didn't care, he didn't worry, he didn't wonder..)
 
 Wyclef and Mary J. Blige
 I'm feelin you girl

 [Mary J. Blige]
 And you're doin, what you're doin, would you do it
 and do it and do it and do it for me..
