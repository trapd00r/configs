I think you wanna come over
Yeah I heard it through the grapevine
Are you drunk or you sober? 
Think about it, doesn't matter, and if
It makes you feel good then I say do it
I don't know what you're waiting for

Feel my temperature rising
It's too much heat, I'm gonna lose control
Do you want to go higher, get closer to the fire
I don't know what you're waiting for

Come join the party, yeah
'Cause anybody, just won't do
Let's get this started, yeah
'Cause everybody wants to party with you

Boy you got a reputation
But you're gonna have to prove it
I see a little hesitation
Am I gonna, have to show you that
If it feels right, get on your marks
Step to the beat boy, that's what it's for

Put your arms around me
When it gets too hot, we can go outside
But for now just come here, let me whisper in your ear
An invitation to the dance of life

Come join the party, it's a celebration
An anybody just won't do
Let's get this started, no more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you

Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
You look familiar
You wanna dance? 
Yeah
I guess I just don't recognize you with your clothes on (laughter)
What are you waiting for?

Come join the party, it's a celebration
An anybody just won't do
Let's get this started, no more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you

Come join the party, it's a celebration
An anybody just won't do
Let's get this started, no more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you

Boy you've got it, it's a celebration
'Cause anybody just won't do
Let's get it started, no more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you

Boy you've got it

'Cause everybody wants to party with you
