Come see, high above.
Come see, high in the heavens.
A new star shining bright.
Out of the darkness, comes a light.

Come here, in a child
Come here, bells that are ringing
And for some distant shore
Sounds of a journey, echo on

This is the night
They say,
Everyone wants a dream.

This is the night
They say
Nothing is as it seems.

Come see, close your eyes.
Come see, give me your sorrow.
And I keep watch for you.
Until the dawn is, breaking through.
Until the morning wakens you.

Come dream, through the night.
Come dream, and then tomorrow
They'll see who, what will know.

Dreams are more precious than gold
Dreams are more precious than gold
Dreams are more precious than gold
