If I go
Before I'm old,
Oh, brother of mine,
Please don't forget me if I go.

Bartender, please,
Fill my glass for me
With the wine you gave Jesus
That set him free after three days in the ground.

Oh, and if I die
Before my time,
Oh, sweet sister of mine,
Please don't regret me if I die.

Bartender, please,
Fill my glass for me
With the wine you gave Jesus
That set him free after three days in the ground.

Bartender, please,
Fill my glass for me
With the wine you gave Jesus
That set him free after three days in the ground.

I'm on bended knees,
I pray, Bartender please.

When I was young,
I didn't think about it;
Now I can't get it out of my mind.

I'm on bended knees,
Father, please.

Oh, and if all this gold
Should steal my soul away,
Oh, dear mother of mine,
Please redirect me if this gold...

Bartender, you see,
The wine that's drinking me
Came from the vine that strung Judas
From the Devil's tree,
His roots deep, deep in the ground.

Bartender, you see,
The wine that's drinking me
Came from the vine that strung Judas
From the Devil's tree,
It's roots deep, deep in the ground, ground.

I'm on bended knees,
Oh, Bartender, please.

I'm on bended knees,
Father, please.

When I was young,
I didn't think about it;
Now I just want to run and hide.

I'm on bended knees, oh, Bartender, please,
Bartender, please...
