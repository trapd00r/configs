Not very often have we met 
But the music's been too bad
Can only sense happiness
if the music is sad

So, I'm going home
I must hurry home
Where a life goes on

We're too old to make a mess
Dreams will keep me young
Old enough to stress
Only mirrors tell the time

So, I'm going home
I must hurry home
So will my life go on

Yes, I'm going home
Going home alone
And your life goes on

So, I'm going home
I must hurry home
So will my life go on

Yes, I'm going home
Going home alone
And your life goes on
