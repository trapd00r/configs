When the world is darker than I can understand.
When nothing turns out the way I planned.
When the sky turns grey and there's no end in sight.
When I can't sleep through the lonely night.


I turn to you.  Like a flower leaning toward the sun.
I turn to you.  'Cos you're the only one.
Who can turn me around when I'm upside down.
I turn to you.


When my insides are wracked with anxiety.
You have the touch that will quiet me.
You lift my spirit.  You melt the ice.
When I need inspiration, when I need advice.


I turn to you.  Like a flower leaning toward the sun.
I turn to you.  'Cos you're the only one.
Who can turn me around when I'm upside down.
I turn to you.


Where would I be?  What would I do?
If you'd never helped me through.
I hope someday if you've lost your way.
You could turn to me like I turn to you.


I turn to you.  Like a flower leaning toward the sun.
I turn to you. 'Cos you're the only one.
Who can turn me around when I'm upside down.
I turn to you.

I turn to you.  When fear tells me to turn around.
I turn to you.  'Cos you're the only one.
Who can turn me around when I'm upside down.
I turn to you.  I turn to you.  I turn to you.
