Run away, run away, run away and save your life 
Run away, run away, run away if you want to survive 
Run away, run away, run away and save your life 
Run away, run away, run away if you want to survive 

Money, sex in full control, a generation without soul 
Perfect people in a perfect world, 
Behind closed doors all in control 
Life, in a world of luxury, 
Cold cash money mentality 
You gotta keep the faith, you gotta keep the faith 
You'd better keep the faith and run away 

Run away, run away, run away and save your life 
Run away, run away, run away if you want to survive
It's time to break free, oh oh oh oh, run away, oh oh oh oh 
You better break free, oh oh oh oh, run away, oh oh oh oh 

Money, sex in full control, look, big brother is watching you, 
Unlock your brain and save your soul, 
No more limits, no more curfew 
Life in the perfect system, 
Take a stand and fight for freedom 
Keep the faith, you gotta keep the faith 
You'd better keep the faith and run away

Run away, run away, run away and save your life 
Run away, run away, run away if you want to survive
It's time to break free, oh oh oh oh, run away, oh oh oh oh 
You better break free, oh oh oh oh, run away, oh oh oh oh 

Run away, run away, run away and save your life 
Run away, run away, run away if you want to survive
It's time to break free, oh oh oh oh, run away, oh oh oh oh 
You better break free, oh oh oh oh, run away, oh oh oh oh
