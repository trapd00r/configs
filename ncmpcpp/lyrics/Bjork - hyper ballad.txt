Send "Hyperballad" Ringtone to your Cell We live on a mountain,
Right at the top.
There's a beautiful view
From the top of the mountain.
Every morning, I walk towards the edge
And throw little things off
Like car-parts, bottles and cutlery,
Or whatever I find lying around.

It's become a habit;
A way
To start the day.

CHORUS:
I go through all this
Before you wake up,
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you.

REPEAT CHORUS.

It's early morning;
No-one is awake.
I'm back at my cliff
Still throwing things off.
I listen to the sounds they make
On their way down.
I follow with my eyes 'till they crash;
I imagine what my body would sound like
Slamming against those rocks.

And when it lands
Will my eyes
Be closed or open?

CHORUS x3.

Safe up here. x16
