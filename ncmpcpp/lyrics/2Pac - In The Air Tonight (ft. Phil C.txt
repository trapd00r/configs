Way back (way back)- back into time (into time)

Chorus:

[Phil Collins]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment
For all my life
Oh Lord, Oh Lord

[Lil' Kim]
Keep still in the shit, killin the rhyme
The Queen stay poppin the wine and cockin the nine
For those who think they stoppin my dough
Wanna copy my show, wha
I'm switchin my flow, can't take it no mo'
Oh you think I'm playin around
I'm layin ya down
Album drop, new millenium shuttin it down
Better off givin it up, I'm rippin it up
Spendin money, livin it up, not givin a fuck

Hiding the tote, runnin the coast
Makin niggas catch the Holy Ghost
I'm realer than most, wha
The trendsetter, the Brooklyn repper
You know the routine
Smoke you like a ciggarette-r
We've been, out in a bit
Y'all still talkin shit
Ain't that a bitch?
What part of the game was this?

[Lil' Kim singing]
Millions I'm holdin'
Drop tops rollin'
Diamonds on my neck
And Bentley ballin'
Me and my niggas gettin' high all day
Straight to the top, cuz we on our way

[Lil' Kim rapping]
Comin' for y'all, comin' for y'all
That's right I got something for y'all
Something for y'all, wha
God bless me, look at all I've been through
It's my time, I can feel it, can't you?

Chorus:

[Phil Collins]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment
For all my life
Oh Lord

Can you feel it coming in the air tonight?
Oh Lord, Oh Lord

[Phil Collins]
Well I remember..

[Lil' Kim]
...back when it used to be the eighties
Said the world was gon' end in 2000 (that's crazy)
I'm the only thing to fear
For the new year
New year, and if BIG was here (woo)
Get the fans, we the ones to talk
We die real on the streets
So watch where you walk
And you can find me, usually
Talkin' dirty to a cat thugged out
Or even kinda nerdy
Lil' Kim, Lil' Cease and JM
Taking over like a plague on a town
All y'all can do is pray and watch it go down
Like when the ball drop
My fam's all I got, we keep it gangsta

Comin' for y'all, comin' for y'all
That's right I got something for y'all
Something for y'all, wha
God bless me, look at all I've been through
It's my time, I can feel it, can't you?

[Phil Collins]

Well, if you told me, you were drowning
I would not a lend a hand
I've seen your face before my friend
But I don't know if you know who I am
Well I was there and I saw what you did
Saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off that grin
I know where you've been
It's all been a pack of lies

[Phil Collins]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment
For all my life
Oh Lord, Oh Lord

I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment
All my life
Oh Lord, Oh Lord
