So long child, I'm on my way
And after all is done, after all is done
Don't be down, it's all in the past
Though you may be afraid

So long child, it's awful dark
And I've never felt the sun
I dread to think of when
When the wind blows
When the wind blows
When the wind blows
When the wind blows

Life burns a savage wound, angry and wrong
Trusting a twisted word, you'll run, run away
You'll take him home
You'll spit and taunt him
But they won't believe you
No matter what you'll say

So long child, it's awful dark
I never felt the sun
I dread to think of when
When the wind blows
When the wind blows
When the wind blows
When the wind blows
