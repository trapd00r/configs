...That I denied one time too many 
She left me at the break of day 
When I awoke she seemed still spinning in my head 
But she was gone, the capsule empty 
And her body dead 
Was all she'd left behind without a last adieu 
Sometimes I wonder if she'd left a hundred years ago 
To start anew we need to be strangers from now on 
And as for love we need to be strangers from now on 

And I remember when she came into my life 
It didn't count who she was or what I was like 
I never meant to hurt her but she never did 
Her name was love, her bodies infinite 
And now she is gone, the capsule empty 
And her body dead 
Sometimes I wonder if she'd left a hundred years ago 
To start anew we need to be strangers from now on 
And as for love we need to be strangers from now on...
