I love a magician 
She can cut me in half 
She can find quarters behind my ear 
And make me laugh, one two one two 
Is this thing on? Let's assess. 
Oh yes, she's the best. There is no contest. 
But I must confess that there are times like when 
She floats me straight up in the air 
Over thirty miles—I don't care. 
Well maybe a little it can really stop 
You from doing something cause you wonder 
Oh, if they'd really drop you. 
She simply wiggles her nose 
And disappears all my clothes 
Really makes me wonder 
Really makes me wonder, wonder 
Now she vanished into thin air 
And doesn't see why I care 
Really makes me wonder 
Really makes me wonder now wonder now 
I love a magician, she does things to 
Keep me amused like when she sticks 
My hair straight up in the air 
For the benefit of her stuck-up friends 
Well, I think it's funny 
But it's a touchy subject 
She likes to set me a trap 
And makes me come with a clap 
Really makes me wonder 
Really makes me wonder, wonder 
She says she can't read my mind 
I know she does all the time 
Really makes me wonder 
Really makes me wonder now wonder now 
There are times I don't know you at all.
