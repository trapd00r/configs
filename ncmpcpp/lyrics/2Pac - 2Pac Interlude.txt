[Tupac Shakur] 
Right now, it is it is almost.. it is almost uhh, 
IMPOSSIBLE for you not to see how strong rap has gotten 
Y'knowhatI'msayin, it's it's like umm.. 
our our brothers and sisters, our youths, and some of our adults 
their ear is PINNED to rap music right now 
And if you really wanna get our message out 
and really wanna start teachin, we need to start doin that 
We we really need to start usin, our methods, y'knowhatI'msayin? 
The Last Poets did it with poetry 
And uhh, and and.. even in our history 
from a ancient Afl- African civilization 
poets went from village to village 
And that's how, stories and messages and lessons were taught 
Y'knowhatI'mssayin, and so like you say, history repeats itself 
And so.. it it was, it was.. at it was, y'know obvious 
It was, pick it up, y'know? 
Bein the race that we are, bein the strong race that we are 
We picked it up, we picked up those positive, those positive vibes 
and we started rappin and so 
I think it is, it's a very good medium too
