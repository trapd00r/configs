One day I'll find relief, I'll be arrived 
And I'll be a friend to my friends who know how to be friends 
One day I'll be at peace, I'll be enlightened 
And I'll be married with children and maybe adopt 
One day I will be healed 
I will gather my wounds, forge the end of tragic comedy 

I have been running so sweaty my whole life
Urgent for a finish line
And I have been missing the rapture this whole time
Of being forever incomplete 

One day my mind will retreat and I'll know God 
And I'll be constantly one with her night, dusk and day 
One day I'll be secure
Like the women I see on their 30th anniversaries

I have been running so sweaty my whole life
Urgent for a finish line
And I have been missing the rapture this whole time
Of being forever incomplete 

Ever unfolding
Ever expanding
Ever adventurous
And torturous
But never done 

One day I will speak freely, I'll be less afraid
And measured outside of my poems and lyrics and art 
One day I will be faith filled 
I'll be trusting and spacious, authentic and grounded and home 

I have been running so sweaty my whole life
Urgent for a finish line
And I have been missing the rapture this whole time
Of being forever incomplete
