Don’t try to explain your mind
I know what’s happening here
One minute it’s love
And suddenly it’s like a battle-field

One word turns into a war
Is it the smallest things that tear us down
My world’s nothing when you don’t
I’m out here without a shield; can’t go back now

Both hands tied behind my back with nothing
Oh no, these times when we climb so fast to fall again
Why we gotta fall for it now

I never meant to start a war
You know I never wanna hurt you
Don’t even know what we’re fighting for

Why does love always feel like a battlefield, a battlefield, a battlefield?
Why does love always feel like a battlefield, a battlefield, a battlefield?
Why does love always feel like..

Can’t swallow our pride,
Neither of us wanna raise that flag, mhmmmm
If we can’t surrender then
We both gonna lose what we had, oh no

Both hands tied behind my back with nothing
Oh no, these times when we climb so fast to fall again
I don’t wanna fall for it now

I never meant to start a war
You know I never wanna hurt you
Don’t even know what we’re fighting for

Why does love always feel like a battlefield, a battlefield, a battlefield?
Why does love always feel like a battlefield, a battlefield, a battlefield?

I guess you better go and get your armor, (get your armor) get your armor
I guess you better go and get your armor, (get your armor) get your armor
I guess you better go and get your…

We could pretend that we are friends tonight (oh-oh-oh)
And in the morning we’ll wake up and we’ll be alright
Cause baby we don’t have to fight
And I don’t want this love to feel like..

A battlefield, a battlefield, a battlefield,
Why does love always feel like a battlefield, a battlefield, a battlefield?

I guess you better go and get your armor…

I never meant to start a war
You know I never wanna hurt you
Don’t even know what we’re fighting for (what are we fighting for?)

Why does love always feel like a battlefield, a battlefield, a battlefield?
Why does love always feel like a battlefield, a battlefield, a battlefield?

I guess you better go and get your armor, (get your armor) get your armor
I guess you better go and get your armor, (get your armor) get your armor

Why does love always feel like…
Why does love always feel like…
A battlefield, a battlefield

I never meant to start a war
Don’t even know what we’re fighting for

I never meant to start a war
Don’t even know what we’re fighting for
