We've been, going together
Too long to be vague
When there's something to say
If it's not now, then it's never
So I'll say it straight out
'Cos I have no doubt, no doubt

Let's get married
I love you and I want to stay with you
Let's get married
Have kids and grow old and grey with you
Let's get married
Hold hands, walk in the park
You can get a cat as long as it barks

We know, other people
Who drifted apart
Who broke each others hearts
But we ain't other people
So we'll do things our way
We're gonna be O.K.
We're gonna be more than O.K.

Let's get married
We're ready for tying the knot
Let's get married
Set the seal on the feelings we've got
Let's get married
We can make each other happy or we can make each other blue
Yeah, it's just a piece of paper but it says "I Love You"
For the good times
For the days when we can do no wrong
For the moments when we think we can't go on
For the family
For the lives of the children that we've planned
Let's get married
C'mon darlin', please take my hand

And I'll be the one
Who's by your side
I'll be the one
Still taking pride
When we're old if they ask me
"How do you define succes?"
I'll say,
You meet a woman
You fall in love
You ask her and
She says "Yes"

Let's get married
I love and I want to stay with you
Let's get married
Have kids and grow old and grey with you
Let's get married
Hold hands when we walk in the park
All right you can get a cat just as lang as it barks
For the good times
For the days when we can do no wrong
For the bad times
For the moments when we think we can't go on
For the family
For the lives of the children that we've planned
Let's get married
C'mon darlin', please take my hand
