I'd rather be liberated, I find myself captivated
Stop doing what you keep doing it too
I'd rather stay bold and lonely, I dream I'm your one and only
Stop doing what you keep doing it too

Things are getting strange, I'm starting to worry
This could be a case for Mulder and Scully
Things are getting strange, now I can't sleep alone

I'd rather be jumping ship, I find myself jumping straight in
Stop doing what you keep doing it too...
Forever be dozy and dim, I wake myself thinking of him
Stop doing what you keep doing it too...

Things are getting strange, I'm starting to worry
This could be a case for Mulder and Scully
Things are getting strange, now I can't sleep alone

Here my bed is made for two and there's nothing I can do
So tell me something I don't know.
If my head is full you, is there nothing I can do?
Must we all march in two by two by two?

And as for some happy ending. I'd rather stay single and thin

Stop doing what you
Keep doing to me...

Things are getting strange, I'm starting to worry
This could be a case for Mulder and Scully
Things are getting strange, now I can't sleep alone... here

Things are getting strange, I'm starting to worry
This could be a case for Mulder and Scully
Things are getting strange, now I can't sleep alone

So what have you got to say to that?
And what does someone do without love?
And what does someone do with love?
And what have you got to say about that?
