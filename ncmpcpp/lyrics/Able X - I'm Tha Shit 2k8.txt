Verse 1 (Skandalous)
 
 Motherfuckers they wanna test me
 Pull out the blunt nigga I'll wreck your shit
 I'm out that window with my 44, another fucking hit
 Don't know who to trust with my shit
 I'm in this click, you in my hood you better know who you fucking with
 Who you stepping with, Skandalous fucking dangerous
 Bitches brains I bust, feel the lust in God we trust
 Nigga I'm at your door, don't pray to God cause you done lost your grace
 Been in this game for too long you bout to lose your face
 I got the mind of a psycho ass ??
 As I take another hit on this shit nigga you dead
 Never ask forgiveness told the Lord to give me grace
 You talked some shit front your boys and as result you lost your face
 Blood all over the place I'm counting the fucking bodies dropping
 I know my destiny cause I can hear the devil knocking
 I done sent body and soul to my eternal flames you best believe
 I numb them bodies and play my fucking game
 I sold my soul at an early age
 And now my hearts releasing daemons in a rage
 My eyes in a daze
 Evertime I close my eyes to go to sleep I see the visions coming
 Is juices running when ya done in
 Fear only make me curious, I'll never be afraid
 But if you slip you pay your life here come the light now nigga they 
 dead
 Crack scarfs for my fucking glory
 Talking shit up in my territory
 Another day another world's sad story
 
 Verse 2 (Steph)
 
 Smoking blunt, smoke a nigga selling dope on the block
 Pop pop goes the glock I bring more nightmare than Hitchcock
 Get ?? when them bodies fall hitting them prisoners hard
 Its your final call bitch I'll smoke you like menthol
 Fuck all you bitches I'm putting you in them bodybags
 Tagging toes, nigga drive slow
 Creeping up out they indo scheming for they cheese
 Slanging oz's and quarter keys niggas dressed in army fatigues
 Freeze your whole coalition
 Strapped with ammunition
 Infrareds digging ditches for chicken heads
 This figure from head to toe
 Labeled as a Jane Doe, leaving bullets in your Lexus door
 But fuck it I'm through with the fairytales
 Cause when some shit jump off, all you murder on tape bitches gone bail
 Who gone prevail when I exhale on you small scale
 Lyrical laggers, wanna be chrome packers
 Spit the facts I'm bout the Lex and the Ac
 My verbal combat will eliminate your whole habitat
 You hoes ain't fucking with that
 Or this, cause I piss on competition
 And have all you hoes in submission
 Trying to recondition your stilo
 Lyrical nino
 I sling rhymes like kilos
 >From here to Puerto Rico
 One other sequel from the infamous unseen
 Scheming for the green smoking bitches and niggas like nicotine
 
 Verse 3 (Mia X)
 
 Cause she up to schemes
 Tired of chasing apple pie dreams
 Mint greens is all I fien for straight shit is all this bitch know
 50's this nine millimeter berreta leaving you wetter than April showers
 Followe by your second line of flowers
 I devour competition, causing complete submissions
 Cooks more dope in my kitchen
 Tricking ass niggas be my victims when night falls
 Ya'll wants to floss but get set-up tied down and tossed
 Boss chick you don't want to see her
 Your bitch can either run for the heater or meet the dumb hoe beaters
 Mia's right and left well known with the clout
 To wire your mouth, knock your grill out
 That's what this here be bout
 So you can doubt what I'm saying and run that lip
 Or get your whole click engulfed in gangsta shit
 Too much to deal with
 I'm still a bitch that' be's designer down stay scheming on the man
 And taking flights, torsoe taped full of contrabands
 My flow so grand it make the beats say damn
 Shit jumps back makes you wanna holler
 But I sees nothing but dollars
 Feminist power
 My lyrics knocking like a KL beat
 It be that she-devil that below sea level bitch you can't see her
 Niggas and broads be trying to figure at 5'4
 How they still need a ladder to face this hoe
 For sure, cause I be living for the drama
 The biggest mama flexing shutting down this motherfucking basement sesion
