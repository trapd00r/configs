He said you stand in your own shoes
I said I'd rather stand in someone else's
He said you look from your direction
I said I like to keep perspective


Close to the middle of the network
It seems we're looking for a center
What if it turns out to be hollow?
We could be fixing what is broken


Between the pen and the paperwork
There must be passion in the language
Between the muscle and the brain work
There must be feeling in the pipeline


Beyond the duty and the discipline
I know there's anger in a cold place
All feelings fall into the big space
Swept up like garbage on the week-end


Between the pen and the paperwork
There must be passion in the language
Between the muscle and the brain work
There must be feeling in the pipeline


All feeling
Falls into the big space
All feeling
Swept into the
Avenues of angles


Between the pen and the paperwork
I'm sure there's passion in the language
Between the muscle and the brain work
I know there's feeling in the pipeline
