Wake up kids 
We've got the dreamers disease 
Age 14 we got you down on your knees 
So polite, you're busy still saying please 
Frienemies, who when you're down ain't your friend 
Every night we smash their Mercedes-Benz 
First we run; and then we laugh till we cry 
But when the night is falling 
and you cannot find the light,light
If you feel your dream is dying 
Hold tight 
Chorus:
You've got the music in you 
Don't let go 
You've got the music in you 
One dance left 
This world is gonna pull through 
Don't give up 
You've got a reason to live 
Can't forget
you only get what we give 
Four a.m. we ran a miracle mile 
we're flat broke but hey we do it in style 
The bad rich 
God's flying in for your trial 
But when the night is falling
and you cannot find a friend, friend
You feel your tree is breaking
Just then
(chorus)
This whole damn world can fall apart 
You'll be ok, follow your heart 
You're in harms way I'm right behind 
Now say you're mine 
(chorus)
Don't let go
We feel the music in you
Fly high 
What's real can't die 
You only get what you give 
Just don't be afraid to leave 
Health insurance rip off lying FDA big bankers buying 
Fake computer crashes dining 
Cloning while they're multiplying 
Fashion shoots with Beck and Hanson 
Courtney Love, and Marilyn Manson 
You're all fakes 
Run to your mansions 
Come around 
We'll kick your ass in! 
Don't let go 
One dance left
