Money make you feel real good
I always take it more than I know I should
You never give it away for free
You're always stealing a little love from me

But you got to give it up
If you want to live it up
You got to give it up
If you want to live it up

Money make you feel real good
You're always taking more than you know you should
You always take it, take it, take it, take it
Take it, take it, take it, take it
Take it, take it, take it, take it
Take it, take it, take it, take it

Give it up
If you want to live it up
You got to give it up
If you want to live it up
You got to give it up
If you want to live it up
You got to give it up
If you want to live it up

These are the parts of a terrible past
And these are the things we can live without
These are the parts of a terrible past
And these are the things we can live without
These are the parts of a terrible past
And these are the things we can live without
These are the parts of a terrible past
And these are the things we can live without
These are the parts of a terrible past
And these are the things we can live without
These are the parts of a terrible past
And these are the things we can live without
These are the parts of a terrible past
And these are the things we can live without
These are the parts of a terrible past
And these are the things we can live without

You got to give it up
If you want to live it up
You got to give it up
If you want to live it up
Oh, you got to give it up
If you want to live it up
You got to give it up
If you want to live it up
You got to give it up
If you want to live it up
You got to give it up
If you want to live it up

These are the parts of a terrible past
And these are the things we can live without
These are the parts of a terrible past
And these are the things we can live without
These are the parts of a terrible past
And these are the things we can live without
These are the parts of a terrible past
And these are the things we can live without
These are the parts of a terrible past
And these are the things we can live without
These are the parts of a terrible past
And these are the things we can live without
