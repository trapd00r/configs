Monday morning was the first time
That I noticed something strange
Now I know with your kiss was not the same
Was it all just in my mind?
Or was it something I should pay attention to?
Then on Tuesday, having lunch with friends
I thought I saw your car
Leaving from our favorite restaurant but too far
For my eyes to see what I feel
Would be heartbreaking if I saw was true, whoo

Wednesday evening
Every time the phone would rang
You'd say hello
When I'd come around you'd say I got to go
You're friends never called line two before
And I don't know nobody named Tyrone
Oh now it's Thursday
You left the house to go to work an hour early
You said you had some papers for your boss to sign
But you left your briefcase home
And when I called you job
They said you were not there oh yeah

Friday night
Is the night we've always had our weekend date
But you showed up at the house extremely late
Without any conversation you just went to bed
And said that you're head ached
Now it's the weekend
And you know that it's the day I do my cleaning
And when I washed your shirts I just could not believe
I'm picking hair weave off your seam
Found a letter in your pocket from the week, please
