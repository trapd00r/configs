hrough wind and rain we got here
Now we're flying babe with no fear
We've been doing pain for so long
When I stare in your eyes it's all gone
Through wind and rain we burn bright
Learn to fly through flames and hold tight
With so many ways to go wrong
But when I look in your eyes they're all gone

And in my dreams it feels like we are forty storeys tall
When you're around ooooh we're untouchable
And in my dreams it feels like we aren't ever gonna fall
We're safe and sound and we're untouchable

It's only real when you're not around
I'm walking in the rain the sun goes down (oh, oh)
And only love can save us now
I need you hear again to show me how (oh, oh)

I know that love shouldn't be so hard
And sometimes we're standing in the dark
But you light up everywhere I go
And I know a heart shouldn't beat so hard
And sometimes we're swimming with the sharks
But you light up and keep me out the cold

And in my dreams it feels like we are forty storeys tall
When you're around ooooh we're untouchable
And in my dreams it feels like we aren't ever gonna fall
We're safe and sound and we're untouchable

It's only real when you're not around
The candle in my head is burning out (oh, oh)
I know that love shouldn't be so hard
And sometimes we're standing in the dark
But you light up everywhere I go
And I know a heart shouldn't beat so hard
And sometimes we're swimming with the sharks
But you light up and keep me out the cold

And in my dreams it feels like we are forty storeys tall
When you're around ooooh we're untouchable
And in my dreams it feels like we aren't ever gonna fall
We're safe and sound and we're untouchable

Whenever you're gone, gone
They wait at the door
And everything's hurting like a bore
Without any meaning
We're just skin and bone
Like beautiful robots dancing alone

Whenever you're gone, gone
They wait at the door
And everything's hurting like a bore
Without any meaning
We're just skin and bone
Like beautiful robots dancing alone

And in my dreams it feels like we are forty storeys tall
When you're around ooooh we're untouchable
And in my dreams it feels like we aren't ever gonna fall
We're safe and sound and we're untouchable
