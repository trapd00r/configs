[Intro: x2]
I done figured this rap shit out
I map shit out strategically
Timing is everything and that seems to be the key
To my success, it's worked for me repeatedly
Let 'em diss you first, and respond immediately
In order to master the art of war, don't start a war
Shit not no more, we done scared em off, there are no more
Victims to stick I'm fixin to pick some and start shit
I'm outta [repeat]
Pictures to rip and shit to throw darts at
Ain't got no more targets, shit Irv and Jeff
We done beat em to death, Benzino went deaf
There seems to just be no one left to bully
Bush is pussy
Why the fuck you think his name's Bush?
Puss is bushy
Ain't shit goin on, shit I been gettin so bored lately
I'm thinkin of doin some shit to get you to go and hate me again
To tell the truth, I liked the shit better then
Shit I could spit better, I'm bout to kick this sick shit again, look
The game just isn't the same, it's changin
Shit Dre's quittin, Jay'z quittin, now it's just gangstas just sayin the same shit
It's ancient, it's fakin
It's makin me so bored, I'mma just make a new language
Fubba you cubba cubba, yubba yub yubba yooba
Yooba can subbabick my dubbibbabick through a tooba
Summaladoomalama
I'm not a human I'm a supersonic neurobonic suicidal unibomber
You think I'm the new Osama,press thinks I'm the new Madonna
Jeffery Dahmer left me with his legacy to carry on
A lotta talk and rumors honest whos the hottest, to be honest
Hip hop ain't been the same since Tupac moved to Cuba on us
