['Pac talking]
Big Syke, Newt, Hank
Beugard, Big Sur (yeah)
Y'all know how this shit go (y'know)
(All Eyez On Me)
Motherfucking O.G.
Roll up in the club and shit (is that right?)
(All Eyez On Me)
(All Eyez On Me)
But you know what?

[2Pac]
I bet you got it twisted you don't know who to trust
So many player hating niggas trying to sound like us
Say they ready for the funk, but I don't think they knowing
Straight to the depths of hell is where those cowards going
Well are you still down nigga? Holla when you see me
And let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me
I got a caravan of niggas every time we ride (every time we ride)
Hitting motherfuckers up when we pass by (when we pass by)
Until I die, live the life of a boss player
Cause even when I'm high, fuck with me and get crossed later
The futures in my eyes, cause all I want is cash and things
A five-double-oh, Benz flaunting flashy rings, 
Bitches pursue me like a dream
Been know to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend
It seems, my main thing was to be major paid
The game sharper than a motherfucking razor blade
Say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
One nigga's getting jealous, and motherfuckers died
Depend on me like the first and fifteenth
They might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me
We got foe niggas, and low riders, in ski masks
Screaming Thug Life every time they pass (All Eyez On Me)

[Chorus 1: 2Pac]
Live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player (All Eyez On Me)
Cause even getting high (All Eyez On Me)
Live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player, cause even getting high

[Syke]
Hey, to my nigga 'Pac,
So much trouble in the world, nigga
Can't nobody feel your pain
The world's changing everyday, times moving fast
My girl said I need a raise, how long will she last?
I'm caught between my woman, and my pistol, and my chips
Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as I dip
I'm lost in the land with no plan, living life flawless
Crime boss, contraband, let me toss this
Needy hookers got a lot of nerve, let my bucket swerve
I'm taking off from the curb
The nervousness neglect make me pack a tec
Devoted to serving this, Moet and pay-checks
Like Akai satellite nigga I'm forever balling
It ain't right parasites triggers and fleas crawling
Sucker duck and get busted, no emotion
My devotion is handling my business nigga keep on coasting
Where you going I been there came back as lonely homie
Steady flowing against the grain niggas still don't know me
It's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit
It ain't funny niggas don't even know how to act, shit!
What can I do, what can I say, is there another way?
Blunts and gin all day, twenty-fo' parlay
My little homie G, can't you see, I'm busta free
Niggas can't stand me, all eyes on me!

[Chorus 2: 2Pac]
I live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live the life as a boss player (All Eyez On Me)
Cause even getting high (All Eyez On Me)
I live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live the life as a boss player (All Eyez On Me)
Cause even getting high

[2Pac]
The feds is watching, niggaz plotting to get me
Will I survive, will I die? Come on let's picture the possibility
Giving me charges, lawyers making a grip
I told the judge I was raised wrong, and that's why I blaze shit
Was hyper as a kid, cold as a teenager
On my mobile calling big shots on the scene major
Packing hundreds in my drawers, fuck the law
Bitches I fuck with a passion, I'm living rough and raw
Catching cases at a fast rate, balling in the fast lane
Hustle til the morning, never stopped until the cash came
Live my life as a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live my life as a boss player, cause even getting high
These niggas got me tossing shit
I put the top down, now it's time to floss my shit
Keep your head up nigga, make these motherfuckers suffer
Up in the Benz burning rubber
The money is mandatory, the hoes is fully strapped
This criminal lifestyle, equipped with the bulletproof vest
Make sure your eyes is on the meal ticket
Get your money motherfucker let's get rich and we'll kick it
All eyes on me!

[Chorus 3: 2Pac]
I live the life as a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live the life as a boss player (All Eyez On Me)
Cause even getting high (All Eyez On Me)
I live the life as a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live the life as a boss player (All Eyez On Me)
Cause even getting high (All Eyez On Me)

Pay attention my niggas
See how that shit go? Nigga walk up in this motherfucker
And it be like "bing!"
Cops, bitches, every motherfucking gbody

Live my life as a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live my life as a boss player, cause even gettin high
I got bustas hoes and police watching a nigga ya know?
[overlap]
I live my life as a thug nigga, until the day I die
Livin life as a boss player, cause even getting high
(All Eyez On Me)
It's like what they think?
I'm walking around with some ki's in my pocket or something?
(All Eyez On Me)
They think I'm going back to jail, they really on that dope

Live my life as a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live my life as a boss player
I know y'all watching, I know y'all got me in the scopes

Live my life as a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live my life as a boss player, cause even getting high
I know y'all know this is Thug Life bay-bay
Y'all got me under surveillance huh?
(All Eyez On Me)
But I'm knowing
