Lying like needles
On forest earth
Euphoric rush
Trees bend to pray for us 
I'm sputtering 
Like cold machines 
Late for the birth ritual, ritual, ritual, ritual 

You can drive my tail 
To watch the circus 
A (birth?) ritual 
A birth of idiots 
Now I woke up blessed 
And good strives for heart ache 
Marked for the death ritual, ritual, ritual 

[Chorus] 
As you start the song 
And face this garden 
I light a cigarette before the execution 
Now you see your crime 
For every miracle 
Add another drug at every birth ritual 

I took the drug 
To make me stay 
And now everything 
Dies in shyness 
The snake retreats 
Admits defeat 
And waits for the birth ritual, ritual, ritual 

(Chorus) 
Shining light 
Child's highs 
Mark his sides 
Bright until the newness wears off 
(Chorus)
