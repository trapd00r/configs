You'll remember me when the west wind moves
Among the fields of barley
You can tell the sun in his jealous sky, 
When we walked in fields of gold

So she took her love
For to gaze awhile 
Among the fields of barley
In his arms she fell as her hair came down
Among the fields of gold

Will you stay with me? 
Will you be my love
Among the fields of barley?
And you can tell the sun in his jealous sky
When we walked in fields of gold

I never made promises lightly,
And there have been some that I have broken
But I swear in the days still left 
We will walk in fields of gold
We will walk in fields of gold

I never made promises lightly,
And there have been some that I have broken
But I swear in the days still left 
We will walk in fields of gold
We will walk in fields of gold

Many years have passed since those summer days
Among the fields of barley
See the children run as the sun goes down
As you lie in fields of gold

You'll remember me when the west wind moves
Among the fields of barley
You can tell the sun in his jealous sky
When we walked in fields of gold

When we walked in fields of gold
When we walked in fields of gold
