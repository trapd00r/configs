A jail cell is freedom from the pain in my home
Hatred passed on, passed on, and passed on
A world of violent rage, but it's one that I can recognize
Having never seen the color of my father's eyes
Yes I dwell in hell, but it's a hell that I can grip
I tried to grip my family, but I slipped
To escape from the pain and an existence mundane
I got a 9, a sign, a set, and now I got a name

Read my writing on the wall
No one's here to catch me when I fall
Death is on my side
Suicide

A jail cell is freedom from the pain in my home
Hatred passed on, passed on, and passed on
A world of violent rage, but it's one that I can recognize
Having never seen the color of my father's eyes
Yes I dwell in hell, but it's a hell that I can grip
I tried to grip my family, but I slipped
To escape from the pain and an existence mundane
I got a 9, a sign, a set, and now I got a name

Read my writing on the wall
No one's ever catch me when I fall
Caught between my culture and the system
Genocide

Read my writing on the wall
No one's ever catch me when I fall
If ignorance is bliss
Then knock the smile off my face, yeah

If we don't take action now
We'll settle for nothing later
We'll settle for nothing now
And we'll settle for nothing later

If we don't take action now
We'll settle for nothing later
We'll settle for nothing now
And we'll settle for nothing later

If we don't take action now
We'll settle for nothing later
We'll settle for nothing now
And we'll settle for nothing later

If we don't take action now
We'll settle for nothing later
We'll settle for nothing now
And we'll settle for nothing later
