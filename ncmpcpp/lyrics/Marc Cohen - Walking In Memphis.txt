Put on my blue suede shoes and I
Boarded the plane
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
In the middle of the pouring rain
W.C. Handy
Won't you look down over me
Yeah, I got a first class ticket
But I'm as blue as a boy can be

Then I'm walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet 10 feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel

Saw the ghost of Elvis
On Union Avenue
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
Then I watched him walk right through
Now, security did not see him
They just hovered round his tomb
But there's a pretty little thing
Waiting for the king
Down in the jungle room

When I was walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet 10 feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel

Now, they've got catfish on the table
They've got gospel in the air
The Reverend Green, be glad to see you
When you haven't got a prayer

But boy you got a prayer in Memphis

Now, Muriel plays piano
Every Friday at the Hollywood
And they brought me down to see her
And they asked me if I would
Do a little number
And I sang with all my might
She said, "Tell me are you a Christian, child?"
And i said, "Ma'am, I am tonight!"

When I was walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet 10 feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel

Walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet 10 feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel

Put on my blue suede shoes and I
Boarded the plane
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
In the middle of the pouring rain
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
In the middle of the pouring rain
