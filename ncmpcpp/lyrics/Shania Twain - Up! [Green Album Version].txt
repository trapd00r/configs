It's bout as bad as it could be
Seems everybody's buggin' me
Like nothing wants to go my way - yeah, it just ain't my day
Nothin's comin' easily

Even my skin is acting weird
I wish that I could grow a beard
Then I could cover up my spots - not play connect the dots
I just wanna disappear

Up, up, up - can only go up from here
Up, up, up - up where the clouds gonna clear
Up, up, up - there's no way but up from here

Even something as simple as
Forgettin' to fill up on gas
There ain't no explaination why - things like that can make you cry
Just gotta learn to laugh

Up, up, up - can only go up from here
Up, up, up - up where the clouds gonna clear
Up, up, up - there's no way but up from here

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah...

When everything's goin' wrong
Don't worry, it won't last for long
Yeah, it's all gonna come around
Don't let it get you down
You gotta keep on holding on

It's bout as bad as it could be
Seems everybody's buggin' me
Like nothing wants to go my way - yeah, it just ain't my day
Nothin's comin' easily

Up, up, up - can only go up from here
Up, up, up - up where the clouds gonna clear
Up, up, up - there's no way but up from here

Oh - I'm going up
Oh - I'm going up
Oh - I'm going up
Oh - I'm going up
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah...
