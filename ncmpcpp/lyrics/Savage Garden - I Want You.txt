Anytime I need to see your face, 
I just close my eyes 
And I am taken to a place where 
your crystal mind and 
Magenta feelings take up shelter 
in the base of my spine 
Sweet like a chic-a-cherry cola 
I don't need to try and explain; 
I just hold on tight 
And if it happens again, I might move 
so slightly 
To the arms and the lips and the face 
of the human cannonball 
That I need to, I want to 

Come stand a little bit closer 
Breath in and get a bit higher 
You'll never know what hit you 
When I get to you 

[chorus:]

Ooh, I want you 
I don't know if I need you 
But, ooh, I'd die to find out 
Ooh, I want you 
I don't know if I need you 
But, ooh, I'd die to find out 

I'm the kind of person who endorses 
a deep commitment 
Getting comfy getting perfect 
is what I live for 
But a look, then a smell of perfume 
It's like I'm down on the floor 
And I don't know what I'm in for  

Conversation has a time and place 
In the interaction of a lover and 
a mate, 
But the time of talking, 
using symbols, using words 
Can be likened to a deep sea diver 
who is swimming with a raincoat 

Come stand a little bit closer 
Breathe in and get a bit higher 
You'll never know what hit you 
When I get to you 

[chorus]

Anytime I need to see your face, 
I just close my eyes 
And I am taken to a place where 
your crystal mind and 
Magenta feelings take up shelter 
in the base of my spine 
Sweet like a chic-a-cherry cola 

I don't need to try and explain; 
I just hold on tight 
And if it happens again, I might move 
so slightly 
To the arms and the lips and the face 
of the human cannonball 
That I need to, I want to 

[chorus]

So can we find out?
