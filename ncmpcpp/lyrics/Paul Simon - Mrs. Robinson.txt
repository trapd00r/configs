And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson 
Jesus loves you more than you will know (Wo, wo, wo) 
God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson 
Heaven holds a place for those who pray 
(Hey, hey, hey...hey, hey, hey) 

We'd like to know a little bit about you for our files 
We'd like to help you learn to help yourself 
Look around you, all you see are sympathetic eyes 
Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home 

And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson 
Jesus loves you more than you will know (Wo, wo, wo) 
God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson 
Heaven holds a place for those who pray 
(Hey, hey, hey...hey, hey, hey) 

Hide it in a hiding place where no one ever goes 
Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes 
It's a little secret, just the Robinsons' affair 
Most of all, you've got to hide it from the kids 

Coo, coo, ca-choo, Mrs Robinson 
Jesus loves you more than you will know (Wo, wo, wo) 
God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson 
Heaven holds a place for those who pray 
(Hey, hey, hey...hey, hey, hey) 

Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon 
Going to the candidates debate 
Laugh about it, shout about it 
When you've got to choose 
Ev'ry way you look at it, you lose 

Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio 
A nation turns its lonely eyes to you (Woo, woo, woo) 
What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson 
Joltin' Joe has left and gone away 
(Hey, hey, hey...hey, hey, hey)
