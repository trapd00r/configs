[DJ Premier scratches]
I'm comin' through
It's the voice you can't ignore
It's Afu

[Guru]
Hey yo, this is Gifted Unlimited, peace, Afu
You know we been doin' it for years, man
Show these fools how it's supposed to be done, baby

[Afu-Ra]
Uh, I spent time learnin' to kill
That's right, I'm stretching out with my tentacles
When I nourish my skills
The illest with that other shit, Perverted with this
Come and step inside the mother ship
I got the codes and manuals and microchip to flip the script
Parallel to my thoughts, tryin' to get
I keep it hooked up, but not the great white hope
Hey yo, Preemo, should I hit 'em with the rope of dope
Sea shells, sea shells by the sea shore
But now I'm slap, tap and a rap an' attack your jaw
Summertime, ladies at the bus stop
When I roll without the drop, they yellin'
"Shimmy shimmy, Coco Pop"
Ill with the slurs, what?
And I'm thick like yoghurt
Quick to quick to quick to bust a fast word
I know you like what you think what you like
But I stick out on a track and blind your third-eye sight

[Guru]
Why do you think that we should settle for less?
Now take a deep breath
No time to get rest when cats is testin' your vest
Kid you know who we are
Afu to the Gang to the Starr
We got props on every boulevard

[Afu-Ra]
I do it like this and that
Straight knowledge drippin' right out my hat
Like sex and candle wax
As a matter of a fact
I take it back, in the days
If you wack, in fact, you get the bozack
And the chickens, are thinkin' they finger-lickin'
Tryin' to get the party kicking
But really they should be stinking
Crack the asphalt, while doing lyrical somersaults
Slang slay your head, bang a boogie
I got a think-tank, that's lighting up with the blinks
Move and sway but I'm compared to mint
Some cats can't forget the spiritual and mental
Straight up, yo, I slap 'em with a miracle
Expressing everything, including the kitchen sink
Building on topics from aluminium and zinc
So while you fix your kicks, I do triple axels
Get in your bath or round the rink

[Guru]
Why do you think that we should settle for less?
Now take a deep breath

No time to get rest when cats is testin' your vest
Kid you know who we are
Afu to the Gang to the Starr
We got props on every boulevard

Why do you think that we should settle for less?
Now take a deep breath
No time to get rest when cats is testin' your vest
Kid you know who we are
Afu to the Gang to the Starr
We got props on every boulevard

[Afu-Ra]
When I spark it up, and you ingest my skills
I'm hanging down like I'm testicles
Romancing like Cassa', more steps than a dancer
Got a Pop Quiz? Yo, I help you with the answers
I'm Master Marvel, scribble the illest novel
80 more albums, I got more pages than the bible
Never allow my energy through Leviticus
As I rebirth my soul, glowing Genesis
Eyes tearing through the fog
Shout my brothers and sisters
Who studied the Qua'ran
From a path of hip-hop
Shall arm in a synagogue
Dinner china mushroom song
As the night prolongs
That means I'm 'bout to put it on
So abrasive, and persuasive
Thugs pulled out of my set, stop pace makers
Peace: computer-whizzes, graph-writers and breakers

[Guru]
Why do you think that we should settle for less?
Now take a deep breath
No time to get rest when cats is testin' your vest
Kid you know who we are
Afu to the Gang to the Starr
We got props on every boulevard

Why do you think that we should settle for less?
Now take a deep breath
No time to get rest when cats is testin' your vest
Kid you know who we are
Afu to the Gang to the Starr
We got props on every boulevard


[DJ Premier scratches]
I'm comin' through
I'm holding aura, it backs the voice you can't ignore
I'm comin' through
It's Afu, you know who, I'm comin' faster

[DJ Premier]
Yo, check this out
You know it's on the popper when I'm on the scene
That's right, it's me, DJ Premier
Representing Gang Starr and all the affiliations along with it
And right about now, you in tune to Life Force Radio
That's the way it goes down, and that's the way it's gonna be
Word up and we outta here, DJ Premier and I'm out
Peace!
