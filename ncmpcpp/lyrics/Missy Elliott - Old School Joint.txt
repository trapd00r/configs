Flip da beat
Oh yeah I'm feelin this one
You remember back in the old school days
You used to have joints like this
and you'd be up in the club dancin like your moms and your pops
Hehe, I know y'all know what I'm talkin about
So we gon' flip it like this, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Before you take me out let's, have a conversation
No touchy touchy cause it might lead to havin relations
Let's get to the point, boy, no abbreviations
Don't wanna give it up too quick, I wanna build up anticipation

[Chorus]
Once you get me will you know how to act
Will you do me right (Ooh, I need to know, I need to know)
Once you get me will you keep my pockets fat
Keep me lookin tight (Ooh, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I wanna give it some time and, get to know eachother
Let's be friends before we think about being lovers
Ain't no need to rush it, if this is forever
If you wait on this love, I promise it'll get mo' betta and betta

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Flashlights (flashlight)
Neon lights (neon light)
Party rides, all night
Love me right, keep me lookin tight (lookin tight)
So nice (so nice)
That's what I's like

[Chorus] - repeat 2X
