Lyrics by Suzanne Vega
Music by Suzanne Vega and Mitchell Froom 

Lolita
Almost grown
Lolita
Go on home


Hey girl
Don't be a dog all your life
Don't beg for 
Some little crumb of affection


Don't try
To be somebody's wife
So young
You need a word of protection


Lolita
Almost grown
Lolita 
Go on home


Hey girl
I've been where you are standing
Leaning in the doorway
In your mother's black dress


So hungry
For the one understanding
Looking for a token of 
Blood or tenderness


Lolita
Almost grown
Lolita
Go on home


Lolita...
